# Using pymongo

Even if the command line interface is cool, it might
be useful to use some driver to connect with the database.
MongoDB provides a list of connector with the most 
used languages.

In the following we use the [pymongo](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/) driver.

Open a `python3`, or even better an `ipython`, terminal terminal using the following command
```
$ ipython
```

You should have already installed the driver. Check that
the program is correctly installed using the following
command
```python
>>> from pymongo import MongoClient
```
To establish a connection with the database you should
use the following instruction
```python
>>> client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)
>>> orders = client["orders"]
```
Notice that for an enterprise solution you should provide
additional information in the connection.

Now the object `orders` represents the MongoDB `db` object.
To access to a collection you should use the same
syntax as the db.
```python
>>> customers = orders["customers"]
```

Now the `customers` object is a representation of 
the collection stored in the database.
The overall syntax is quite similar to those of
the shell one. Notice that the `find` method
return a cursor instead of the result. This is
useful for large samples.
```python
>>> cursor = customers.find()
>>> data = list(cursor)
```

Use `print(data)` to show the content.

### Exercise

As a simple test write a `python` code that select
the data in the *airbnb* databases:
1. select apartments where the number of bedrooms is 2 or 3 and city is New York or Chicago;
2. select apartments where the number of bedrooms is 2 and price is lower than 800.
