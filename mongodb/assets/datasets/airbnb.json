The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A&G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend."

Das Apartment ist charmant, die M\u00f6bel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den sp\u00e4ten Abend und auch morgens geht's fr\u00fch los mit fr\u00f6hlichen L\u00e4rm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also f\u00fcr Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tr\u00f6stet \u00fcber den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und g\u00fcnstig fr\u00fchst\u00fccken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und gro\u00df genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. "

However, if you are looking to step outside of your door and start enjoying what Porto has to offer, I recommend this location."

There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers (not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \nThe pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\nOn the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphill walking distance from the house."

But in warmer months Im sure this isn't an issue.\nThe beds are a little hard with one slightly out of shape,  and the shower is fairly basic (hand held) but does the job. Because of the central location some noise can be expected early in the mornings. \nOverall the apartment suited our needs for our short stay and the price is more than reasonable for what we got."

The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \n\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15\u20ac for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \n\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it."

        "comments": "This is everything we expected and hoped for in a sub-$100/night condo stay in Waikiki. This definitely isn't the Ritz, and if you're looking for a luxury get-away, you're barking up the wrong tree. However, if you're like we were: first time visitors on a budget with humble taste, then this place is perfect. The location is a tiny bit removed from the touristy Beachwalk shopping area, but not so far as to preclude you from limbering up for a spirited walk over there. And by the marina, you're actually quite close to the Ala Moana mall. So, the location is good. The place itself is a modest studio setup, but perfectly adequate with a good sized bed for a couple, enough space for your luggage, and a kitchenette and bathroom that though tight, is perfectly fine. There's also cable and internet if you're looking for homey creature comforts. It was also fantastic to have a free parking space included, an air conditioning wall unit, and the panoramic window view was pretty cool, though you only really get a peak of the beach. Also, David was very good about staying in contact with us the day we arrived to get acclimated, and we did not have further occasion to require his services the rest of our stay, so our contact was minimal, but satisfactory ... no problem there. The minor quibbles we had were pretty thin walls, so we would often hear the murmur of the neighbors' TVs. Also, there seemed to be two elevators working the entire building, so they could take quite a while to pop up. Again though, if you're like us, your #1 priorities are spend a minimal amount of time in your room, get out to experience Hawaii, come back to a sanitary place to sleep at night, all while staying within a reasonable budget. This place fit the bill, and we would recommend it to anyone with the same priorities."

It's definitely not luxurious but has the basics and is in a great location. It fits 2 people but more would be cramped. \nYou can hit the beach in as little as 5 mns walking or get to central Waikiki beach in 15-20 mns walking.  It's also easy to catch a bus to visit something outside Waikiki. There is a convenience store nearby, as well as several breakfast and restaurant options. The apartment has a small kitchen with cooking utensils but we ended up mostly eating dinners out. \nDavid was courteous and likely very knowledgeable about the area but we didn't ask him for suggestions, we ended up just using our guide book. \nOverall if you want to experience Waikiki without spending a fortune or being pampered, this is a great option. Mahalo David!"

It's a small studio, and not luxurious, but great if you want a functional, reasonably comfortable and very affordable base for exploring Oahu. The parking space is wonderful if you rent a car, as otherwise you're looking at an additional $15-$20 a day. The building is right on Ala Moana Blvd so it's noisy if you keep the windows open, but that's also true of many high-price Waikiki hotel rooms. Air conditioning is a bit noisy; I slept with earplugs but my boyfriend didn't need them (I'm a light sleeper and use them at home). The condo has a full size fridge, small cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, coffee press, beach chairs, some knackered beach mats, towels, pots, plates, etc.. Wifi is a plus. The bathroom appears quite recently updated, and though small is nice - great shower. \r\n\r\nCons: There's no lanai and the view is very partial, but to us those were small things. Elevators were sometimes very slow and occasionally out of commission, which was a hassle and a bit concerning.\r\n\r\nWe never actually met David. All was handled by text and email. He instructed us to get someone to let us in to the building, which seemed a bit dodgy, but in the end it was no problem, and he said to call if there was any issue. Condo door was unlocked and keys were on the table.\r\n\r\nI would consider staying here again if I plan to stay in the Waikiki vicinity. \r\n\r\n"

Accessories for enjoying the sand and surf are available for use, pool, and hot tub as well, and secure parking which is a plus.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for expansive ocean views, a room to hang out and relax in with up to date decor, and where you can easily meet and get to know people staying in the complex then this wouldn't be for you. The dependability of the elevators, particularly during high winds, is a bit of a concern.\r\n\r\nI never met David, things were handled via airbnb email. I spoke with him on the phone when my plans changed and he was flexible in changing the dates of the original reservation.\r\n"

The cabinets and doors felt like they needed an update and the bed wasn't the most comfortable.

All of this for under $110/night, I couldn't have asked for more.  If ever back in Oahu, I'll be sure to reach out to David again."

As a former 5-year resident of Honolulu I can attest that this building is conveniently located at the entrance of Waikiki close to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and Ala Moana Beach.

I travel to Honolulu 4 times a year and always stay in a hotel, but my cousin recommended I try Airbnb as a less expensive alternative.  I had some technical issues when I first checked into the studio getting the window A/C unit (A/C remote I believe had dead batteries) and cable TV to work (T/V HDMI input wrong) but with David conveniently living in the building, he was quick to remedy the situation.

Whether you've got a car, plan to walk, or use public transport, the building was right in the middle of the hustle and bustle. We found the ABC store just beside the building very useful. The AC worked perfectly! Kept us cool and comfortable. \n\nDealing with David was a pleasure. He remained in close communication with us. Met him once, asked us how we were doing, and was very pleasant.\n\nFor the price and the location, this is a great room!"

One had apparently been out of service for a couple of weeks and then the other stopped working.  After a few climbs to the 16th floor at least one was back in service.  Both David and AirBNB were very attentive and I got a partial refund for that day.  \n\nThere is shopping nearby.  Cleanliness was good.  David lives next door and so can be there quickly if needed.

If you're looking for a no frills, small but clean place to stay where you can save a few $$ by cooking and warming local meals easily in the mini kitchen and walking to the Hilton Hawaiian Village (.8 mi.) this is the place for you. Elevator was a bit slow so if you have to be somewhere on time you'll need to allow maybe 10-15 additional min. A/C worked but slow upon startup but who cares if you're enjoying the outdoors and rarely in the room? Ran into David in the lobby just before checking out--he is kind and lovely!

Of note are the windows which span 18 feet to provide good natural lighting, a partial view of the marina and ocean front, and good ventilation (we never used the A/C).  We were impressed with the location \u2013 walking distance to the hotel beaches, the Fort Derussy military facilities, Ala Moana Park and Shopping Mall, public transportation, restaurants, and convenience stores.  The elevator service for the 40 story/140 unit building  is an ongoing problem, with only one ten-person lift  operating \u201cin slow mode for  safety\u201d or not at all if winds are high.  You'll certainly need patience when gaining access to the apartment and possibly physical endurance to negotiate the stairs (we only had to climb the stairs 3 times in 2 weeks)."

We were able to walk to the conference center for our event and to great beaches, restaurants and the world's largest outdoor mall. David was very easy to get a hold of and quick to respond to any questions we had. The apartment was clean and very functional. The elevator took time, especially at certain times during the day, but overall was not too inconvenient. We were grateful that we were able to park here too. We would recommend staying here and would like to stay again when we return "

The lift system is undergoing renovation but only once waited for about 5 minutes, the other times I waited for the usual of a building of 40 floors. The parking space is a big deal because in that region the parking is very expensive. The flat is close to restaurants and is a few minutes walk from Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana mall. If I go back to Honolulu, I intend to stay again in this flat."

One downside would be only the single elevator in action but it wasn't a dealbreaker and an easy work around. Again, location here is key. This apartment is right in the heart of it in easy access to all the main Waikiki amenities. Parking on site was great too. Would def stay here again! Cheers. "

The mall is just down the street or you could walk there, free parking at the mall if you do drive. Down the street on Kalakaua is Luxury Row. The world\u2019s top fashion houses\u2014Tiffany & Co., Coach, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Gucci, Tod\u2019s, Bottega Veneta and Hugo Boss it was fun to go in the shops. Having a free parking space is a bonus. The view of the marina and ocean was beautiful. I could see boats headed out to sea and parasailers. Laundry located on the 5th floor along with the ice machine if you're headed out for the day a small cooler was provided. Vending machines are on the 2nd floor or you can walk to the ABC store at the corner. Bed was soft and comfortable. Air-conditioner works perfectly or you can open the window for an ocean breeze. Great pressure in the shower and plenty of towels. If you want to eat in there is a microwave, stove and fridge. During busy times you may have to wait for the elevator, only 1 is working, but there are stairs."

Appliances were dirty so we did not use them and the sponge in the kitchen had hairs stuck on it. There was also hair on the floor and restroom. I feel like with the $75 cleaning fee, they needed to do a much better job. The TV had no reception so we weren\u2019t able to use it. The mattress was pretty hard to sleep on. Although we were aware of the elevator issues, the wait for the elevator took up to 15 mins at times.\n\nWas located in a very nice location, close to everything. You could walk everywhere. The host was very nice and contacted us before arrival and before leaving.\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re looking for a comfortable stay, I would suggest going to a hotel."

Be sure to get malasadas from Leonard's Bakery, then snorkel Hanauma Bay and eventually get spicy shrimp at Ted's Bakery :D"

David responded usually within two hours.  We were disappointed with the rental but David worked with us to adjust the rental fees.\n\nThe biggest issue we saw was that the condo was dirty.  With a cleaning fee of $100 and the nice pictures on the Airbnb website, we expected a mostly dust free and clean rental.  We talked with David about the dirty items (there were many) and a couple missing items.  He was apologetic and did his best to help salvage our stay. \n\nWe ended up leaving before the end of the rental agreement and David worked with us on that.  After our stay, David messaged me to say that the items I told him were all addressed.  I would recommend that the next renter message David and verify.\n\nBecause of the location, the free parking, and David, I would rent the condo again."

The Murphy bed was comfortable, and the AC unit (not pictured) kept it nice and cool.  \r\nAlthough I didn't meet her, she arranged for a neighbor to meet me and show me in. He was cool and so were any other neighbors that I met. \r\nShe also left a list of suggestions where to shop and eat, along with menus which was helpful when I needed a late night meal. \r\nHighly recommended. \r\n"

The bed is surprisingly comfy and firm (I have never slept in a Murphy bed before) and the shower had plenty of hot water and great pressure. Greta was very communicative and friendly, and was also incredibly accommodating when I had something come up unexpectedly and needed to stay a couple hours longer than I anticipated. Overall all it was a very cozy stay in a great location!"

I would describe the apartment as a very warm, personal, comfortable and homey place to stay. It\u2019s a corner apartment with good light, lots of books and  very good energy. Plus, the beds are quite comfortable. My daughter exclaimed \u201cHey Dad, come lie down in this one. You\u2019ll never want to get up!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was incredibly well located and enjoyable. The train stops  a half block away, and there are numerous excellent restaurants and conveniences close by. Greta, the host, provides a first-rate list of recommendations.\r\n\r\nGreta was a personable, helpful and extremely welcoming host. She was very quick to respond to my online inquiries and, once we arrived, to any further requests for advice.\r\n"

The house is charming and comfortable, and very conveniently located right by the 1 train. We were two of us and only used one room, but the house can fit another person or two. \r\nFor anyone visiting NYC and looking to be in the city but not in the midst of the city noise, this is a great place to stay! You can be downtown in 20 minutes. "

The Murphy (fold-down) bed has a very thick memory foam mattress that is extremely comfortable.  Samantha (the cat) was a sweet little presence, but she kept mostly to herself so we barely saw her.  The location is great, less than a block to the 1 line, and there are several nice restaurants in the neighborhood.  Finally, Greta herself was a perfect host:  kind but not intrusive, thoughtful in her preparations for guests, and available should any problems arise (though none did).  A great airbnb experience!"

I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\r\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\r\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \r\n\r\nI would totally stay here again.  "

Her apt is located close to all amenities, Central and Riverside Parks, and bus/subway stops. The apt is clean, more spacious than expected, well stocked with anything you could possibly need, and has very comfortable beds and a first rate shower. I was travelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom! This is not fancy accommodation but warm and homey and probably a good representation of how an average New Yorker lives, although I suspect not many are as organized as Greta. Much recommended!"

The subway entrance close to the apartment was manned and easy to buy and top up your pass, it is the only way to travel around the city. On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport. Once again Greta allowed us to arrive and leave at times that suited us with our luggage which didn't leave us stranded for hours with difficult flight times from Australia which was a great relief, thanks so much Greta!"

Birds singing in the trees outside, comfy beds, loads of restaurants and grocery nearby. Lovely easy walks to Central Park, Riverside Park. Subway stop right on the corner. We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. "

I even walked to Leblon from there in under 40 minutes. \n\nThe hosts met me up front and helped me with my luggage. They don't speak English, but are very charming and helpful, so we communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate, using (Hidden by Airbnb) .\n\nThe building is slightly older. One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. \n\nThe bed isn't the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it's fine. \n\nThere is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. \n\nThe WiFi is strong and reliable. \n\nThere is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks. Excellent for visitors. A drug store is also available on the next block at the corner. \n\nOverall the inconveniences were small and the positives of this location was great. "

El departamento estaba muy limpio apenas llegamos, con todo en su lugar. Ten\u00edamos todo a nuestra disposici\u00f3n, todo bien ordenado.\r\nValeria nos recibi\u00f3 en la entrada y nos entreg\u00f3 las llaves en mano, nos explic\u00f3 todo paso a paso del departamento. Su llavero ten\u00eda una tarjeta de descuento para el supermercado, ella nos lo prest\u00f3 y nos sirvi\u00f3 mucho para hacer las compras. Valeria fue de gran ayuda en todo momento. Previo a llegar se contact\u00f3 conmigo, tambi\u00e9n durante la estad\u00eda por si necesit\u00e1bamos algo y previo a nuestra partida.

Zudem ist ein Supermarkt direkt neben dem Eingang! Wir haben uns auch Nachts sicher gef\u00fchlt und w\u00fcrden die Unterkunft herzlichst weiter empfehlen."

Ana Valeria is a sweet and considerate host. \n\nI would not call the apartment luxurious, but it has everything you need and it\u2019s clean. A small kitchen, and laundry is a must for me. If you\u2019re like me, and you love Rio, and go to the beach everyday, there is no better location. I can hop on a skateboard and get to Leme or leblon, no prob. \n\nI won\u2019t say more, so when I want to book again it will be available!!\n\nThank you Ana Valeria. Beij\u00e3o, amiga."

The flat is light and spacious, kitchen well-equipped, bed comfortable (both beds actually), and bathroom clean, with great shower pressure. Zeynep prepared a note with key information about the flat, which was great to have for reference. I especially appreciated the ground coffee and coffee maker. The fact that there was a desk in the house made my stay all the more comfortable - I had a proper place to sit down at my computer.\r\n\r\nIt's clear that Zeynep has put a lot of care into making her flat a home - it's an awesome flat! \r\n\r\nZeynep lives a five min walk to the sea, with a great park along the water front. There are plenty of hip cafes and coffee shops in the neighborhood (Moda), all a short walk from the flat. And it's only a 15 mins walk to the Kadikoy ferry, which offers easy access to the rest of Istanbul."

O bairro do Catete tem uma localiza\u00e7\u00e3o boa, conseguimos ir para a Lapa \u00e0 p\u00e9 e tamb\u00e9m para outros lugares como o aterro e a praia do Flamengo durante o carnaval. A esta\u00e7\u00e3o de metr\u00f4 tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 perto e tem v\u00e1rias op\u00e7\u00f5es de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o muito pr\u00f3ximas \u00e0 casa. O layout da casa assemelha-se \u00e0 um hostel, o quarto que eu fiquei tem tamanho excelente para 4 pessoas e tem ar condicionado, o que faz muita diferen\u00e7a com o calor que est\u00e1 no Rio de Janeiro. Existem 4 banheiros, que s\u00e3o suficientes para o n\u00famero de pessoas que cabem na casa, entretanto durante todos os dias que passei l\u00e1, o banheiro n\u00e3o foi limpo nenhuma vez, por sorte os h\u00f3spedes estavam mantendo-o em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de uso, mas seria importante limpar o banheiro de vez em quando. \r\nOutro ponto importante \u00e9 que os quartos s\u00e3o ligados por uma porta que n\u00e3o tem fechadura e \u00e9 bem fina, ou seja, a privacidade n\u00e3o \u00e9 garantida e o barulho de um quarto pode ser ouvido perfeitamente no outro.\r\nO pre\u00e7o \u00e9 justo pelo que \u00e9 oferecido, seria importante apenas melhorar a limpeza e verificar se \u00e9 poss\u00edvel fechar a comunica\u00e7\u00e3o dos quartos."

Even though we booked our room through Airbnb, we were welcome to all the amenities the hotel had to offer.  We were pleased from our arrival at the hotel, where the exterior was as pretty as the interior and greeted by Robert whose very pleasant demeanor was refreshing.  Each of the staff at the hotel were very professional and accommodating but Robert stood out from the rest.  I was unfortunate enough to have left my phone at a nearby shop after returning via the hotel shuttle, when notifying the front desk to see if I had left my phone in the back seat, Robert quickly responded with his assistance in searching for the item, then driving us immediately to the last location while he assured us he would be outside waiting so we would not have to walk back. I did in fact find my phone at that location (thanks to a good Samaritan) and Robert refused to take compensation for his kindness.  The only thing I would do differently on our next stay is to spend the extra for the room with the patio, as the view from the hotel is quite nice and the breezes up there were wonderful.  We not only will be back to visit the lovely hotel but will gladly recommend it to all who might be vising the Greenpoint area. "

Indeed, because of a flight schedule change, I asked the Airbnb host and the welcome desk of the hotel how I could manage my last night cancellation to be refund. I did exactly what they asked me to do and have been informed two days after that they refused my request of refunding... Despite the policy rules, I found it very dishonest and not correct at all as I have asked them before doing the cancellation on Airbnb and the flight confirmation.\nMoreover, I felt insulted when they made me left the welcome desk to go to the basement in order to let other clients of the hotel believe everything is perfect (I was calm and just trying to solve the issue).\nSo to conclude, the room ok but bad experience in this Airbnb that is an hotel!"

Fabio was very accommodating during check-in, even though we had arrived late in the evening, and took the time to explain the apartment and the city itself. The unit is an easy 5-minute walk from the Trindade Metro Station. There were plenty of bars and restaurants nearby, and two supermarkets within 5-minutes of walking (one was open on Sundays, which saved our lives). Though the apartment is located in a lively area, an extra set of shutters provides an additional layer of sound insulation which was a big plus! \r\nCons: The apartment did not have shampoo/conditioner during our stay. Neighbors could be loud at times. Very little sound insulation on the apartment unit door.\r\nOverall: My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Fabio's apartment building. If we are able to visit Porto again, we would definitely stay in this charming apartment again! Thank you, Fabio!"

It was very nice of him to tell us how to get from Lisbon to his place in Porto and to respond so quickly considering we had booked just the night before! Fabio really likes his hometown and took the time to show us on the map what to do and where to go. The little guidebook in French was very helpful when walking around! The apartment is just as described and just like it is on the photos:clean, functional, pretty and very well-located. It faces the street but it's not loud at night. You can walk anywhere from Fabio's flat. We had a lovely time and we were very happy in Porto :)"

He was waiting for us when we arrived, and then he told us everything important about the city, gave us information about the sights, how to reach them and so on. So he told us for example that we didn\u00b4t have to use public transportation, and that is absolutely true, because the apartment is so good located, that you can reach every important point by walk. But if you have to use the underground it is close to the flat, so get to the airport or the beach isn\u00b4t a problem. The flat is extremely clean, and furnished very modern, so it was a great feeling to stay here. Especially for those of you who like to party with the domestic, there are a lot of bars in the neighbourhood, which are full at night, so you can enjoy a walk at night there. I would always choose this apartment again and would recommend it to everyone. Thank you Fabio."

That's true but be aware that the isolation inside the building isn't really good. So if you're not lucky (just like us) we'll have some trouble to sleep at night."

Gracias a  F\u00e1bio y a su madre por la atenci\u00f3n que nos prestaron."

There is a nice queen sized bed, closets for storage, and a nice little kitchen with stove and refrigerator.   The room has good natural light and clearly has been recently renovated.   So, while the exterior of the building and hallways look a bit old and worn, the apart,ent itself is quite nice and comfortable.   There are numerous restaurants and bars to visit nearby.  There is also parking available just right up the street.  We liked this apartment and would definitely consider staying there again."

The apartment was spotlessly clean and the kitchen was well equipped with cooking utensils, coffee maker, kettle, stove, etc. there was even salt, pepper and oil. Much appreciated as my husband and I cooked breakfast every morning. We LOVED the location. We walked everywhere from the apartment. Minutes from the Sao Bento(?) train station and many other attractions. There was a supermarket and laundromat within a few blocks as well as a variety of different cafes and restaurants. The apartment has been completely and tastefully updated and is completely secure.  We had a wonderful five days in F\u00e1bio\u2019s apartment and would stay there again if back in Porto. "

Good eating spots close by as well as a grocery store across the street. Highly recommended to all of you."

However, the location itself appeared to be great: the neighborhood around was magnificent, a very vibrant area, with extremely cheap and nice restaurants, street food vendors, shops etc everywhere. And actually, not touristic at all, you are going to see how local people live around there. Especially Mong Kok, which is just a little bit south, I really enjoyed walking around in the evenings. There are plenty of bus stops around, and the subway is at most 5 minutes away.\n\nThe place was also very nice. It was nice to see how common houses there look like and live there. Do not expect high luxuries or something, it is just a normal house. For me, it was a very nice place and adequately clean. There is also kitchen but I did not use it; there is tons of great and cheap food around, so there was no reason to spend time cooking (but Vicky one cooked and shared)! In general, I did not experience any negative issue regarding the facilities of the house.\n\nVicky provides with a sim card with unlimited internet, so it is even better than just having wifi in the house, as you can have internet in your smartphone or laptop everywhere you go. This helped navigating around the city a lot.\n\nVicky and her flatmate, J., were really nice and friendly. Initially, Vicky gave exact and clear instructions on how to get there. Both gave quite many suggestions on what to do in the city, and I even spent time with them. Both seem very interested in interacting with the guests, as long as they have time, of course. \n\nOverall, I am really enjoyed my stay there. I enjoyed being in that location and walking around. Everything concerning the house was working fine, making my stay in Hong Kong comfortable. Also I am very happy to have met Vicky and J., and enjoyed our interactions. I would certainly recommend."

Didn't meet her but we managed to communicate through messenger and she explained everything well. I had no problems checking into her home on my own. Just be sure to take the odd numbered elevator and remember the building door gate is closed after 10pm. Also, the night bus to the airport is a short walk away on Nathan Road!"

She also let me check-in earlier than the listed time since my flight arrived early.\n\nAs for the place, what you get is a simple, cozy room that\u2019s perfect for solo travelers. It is spacious enough to have room for luggage and there is a desk where I was able to comfortably work. The room has very good air conditioning that keeps the room cool despite the hot and humid weather in Hong Kong.\n\nIt is very close to MTR and bus stations so it\u2019s easy to get around if you feel like exploring. There are also shops and convenience stores nearby if you ever decide to grab a quick snack.\n\nI had a very pleasant stay at Yi\u2019s place during the 3 nights I spent in Hong Kong."

I was not able to sleep when I was there because it was cold, and the bed blanket was very thin.  I could also hear everything going on in the living room . The neighborhood was depressing. Several people warned me about walking alone in the area late at night. I ended up spending a lot of time and money looking for an alternative place after I arrived in Hong Kong. It was close to New Year's Eve, so I had to return to this place for the last nights of my stay as I could not find an affordable hotel room. I cannot recommend this place."

The apartment is very quiet for the area. Although I never met Yi in person she was always accessible to communicate. The room was very sparse but functional wifi was good.\n\nThe place has 3 bedrooms, a common living room with a table, a Chinese style kitchen and a very tiny showering area with hot water which is typical of Hong Kong apartments. There is a functional  TV. The price  is fantastic, cannot be matched.\n\nNow the not so good. The place is the most dirty place I have ever stayed at in HK, and at one point I lived for many years in HK. Yi mentioned the cleaning fee was for the bedrooms only and also no towel is included, which I believe she listed but I did not notice.  The place is good for backpackers and undergraduates. The entire week I was there 4 to 5 men and women stayed there and I can state the bathroom was never cleaned. The kitchen looks like a tornado hit it, and some of the grime is that thick amber tacky stuff from years of grease buildup. The living room is a thick dusty mess, the sheet covering the couch reeks. I had no idea someone, an airline stewardess who I never saw, had her personal things there and in fact the apartment was her home.  I borrowed a mirror left out on the table, and ate some crackers that I mistakenly thought were left by previous guests and it caused huge problems but I immediately returned the mirror and replaced the crackers.\n\nAll in all a mixed experience. I am sure others saw what I saw, but did not mention the messy aspect in their reviews. I am not being picky, but I wish I had know before I booked what I would actually encounter.\n\n Still it is a good deal, best walked into with your eyes wide open and a high tolerance for filthy common areas."

The\u00a0room that I booked has windows and is equipped with strong\u00a0aircon. Overall, I enjoyed my stay in this apartment. This is a very good area to experience local Hong Kong life where one can see elderly folks, mummies with children, blue collar workers, and of course office workers mingling with each other. Though this area in Sham Shui Po is not posh, its down to earth vibes makes this place very real.\u00a0"

He was very accommodating with check-in and check out times. \nOnly downside is that the apartment doesn't have wifi, so perhaps not ideal for business travellers or longer stays. "

The only very small negative we can say is the noisyness at night on the weekend BUT you can pop to the pharmacy next door and pick up some earplugs and that solves the problem!! Absolutely LOVED the location and decor of the apartment. Ben was so easy to communicate with and made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed :-) If you stay here, it is well worth looking at Ben's suggestions for top spots in the area. We went down the road to Bourke St Bakery everyday (amazing coffee and food!!) and went to the Italian restaurant Vacanza on our last night-simply delicious! We would 100% stay again on our next visit to Sydney :-)"

I let ben know and he didn't reply. I chased 2 days later and he agreed to come and take a look - afterwards the issue was much worse and the entire floor was covered in water, the shower then also wouldn't turn off. Ben told me he would look into a plumber coming and once again failed to get in touch - I chased and said it was uninhabitable like that .. and Ben then demanded that we leave that very day with no compromise with time to find somewhere else, despite us having 4 nights left and visiting from London. \nAwful experience all around."

Within about a 1.5 mile radius (35 min walk) we could really get to any part of town of interest, and anything else uber is always convenient. The place is small and cozy, nothing more you need for your stay. The TV is a smart TV with the youtube app which (we didnt realize till after staying in our other airbnb's without it) was awesome! \n\nThe only thing is, the bed and the couch kind of sunk in. So we ended up sleeping on the ground. Which honestly isnt bad at all, and made my back feel muuuch better the next day. Honestly didnt detract from the experience at all."

Not to mention the extras that I wont bother to take next time we stay like umbrellas, shopping bags, tea bags, band aids and spare blankets. Perhaps having  a hairdryer available would have lightened my luggage! \nCheck in and check out was easy. Ben was available ,approachable and very helpful. \nThe location was perfect for exploring Sydney. A 20 min stroll down historic Oxford St to Darling Harbour. Many different buses right out the front to Centre Point, Bondi, Circular Quay  just to mention a few. Don't forget to get your Opal card from any newsagent and you can top it up with cash on line! Walking distance to the train to explore further a field.\n The studio apartment on the 7th floor has spectacular views ( the photos don't lie!) and is nestled in a friendly community with many restaurants/cafes/shops/chemists all within walking distance. We will be back for many visits I am sure...thanks again Ben!"

        "comments": "Worst Airbnb experience ever! On arrival, the apartment was quite grubby and full of host's personal possessions with only 2 drawers left for the two of us over a fortnight. The fridge had half empty jars, food stains were all over the cabinet doors, and the place was dusty.\nWe had a disaster in that we accidentally left the keys in the apartment (that locks behind you!). We were unable to contact Ben for over 2 days as he had left the country without informing us - ending with us out on the street for hours, having to stay in a hostel overnight and eventually paying for a locksmith as we desperately needed our belongings. Ben was not even remotely apologetic once he finally got in contact with us. \nOnce we asked him if it was possible for him to reimburse for the locksmith and other costs, he replied aggressively with snarky and unnecessarily nasty comments about our stay - saying we had left wet towels on the floor when actually we had left one wet towel in the laundry basket that we had used to clean the water from the leaking toilet that was a great inconvenience throughout our stay and has been a complaint from another guest. Also said we raked through his personal belongings which were against his 'rules', when actually we only used a couple of towels from a drawer since he only left us one bath towel for two people for a fortnight. Ben has also attempted to charge us 100AUD regarding a small stain on the bed sheet, which is a completely ridiculous price especially considering the fee that we paid for cleaning.\nFurthermore, we asked where he would like his new keys to be left so he could get back in his apartment - to which eventually he said to 'leave them on the kitchen table'. This obviously doesn't make any sense and he only replied a few hours before our departure so we replied we would leave one of the keys in an envelope in his letterbox under his other mail. Only after we requested reimbursement days after we had left, he replied in a hostile manner that he had to pay for his own locksmith as we didn't leave him his key(?). \nOverall a dreadful experience that we wouldn't like anyone else to go through, as leaving the keys in an apartment when the door locks behind your back could essentially happen to anyone. This could have been handled far more efficiently & pleasantly if the host had actually been a decent person so BEWARE."

From this place you can visit most monuments in the European side of Istanbul with the least complications (bus stop 1 min away and it serves Sishane metro in 10 min). If you take the bus to Sishane you can have 1 hour walk to most historical places in the European part. Next to his place there is a big market (both sides of a long street) with lots of local Turkish food. Just before his place, you can identify a small restaurant and a small grocery store. \n\nAli is such a great host with distinguished Turkish hospitality. He helped me several times to locate appropriate places for buying gifts. We had interesting discussions and his excellent English helped us had rich cultural exchanges. \n\nI'd recommend this place if you want to get a great value of your money and enjoy a true Turkish life experience (neighborhood and hosting)."

So you can\u2019t leave his home without a portion of inspiration! \nBy the way for every guest he has an gorgeous surprise :)\n\nIf you want to meet a friend, not just a host, don\u2019t doubt - come to Ali\u2019s home!"

His flat is well located close to the city centre, but quiet enough to relax, the room and sofa bed were great! Would especially recommend this for a solo traveller such as myself. 5 stars!"

Desire\u00e9 was exceptionally communicative and helpful, across arrival instructions and helpful hints, to being extremely flexible with my check in and departure times from the property. She was wonderfully generous with items left in the fridge for me to help myself to, and even some lovely fresh flowers for me on arrival. It's a gorgeous apartment right in the hub of the city BUT with the bedroom double glazed I had some of the best nights sleeps here I've had in ages. Terrific stay. Best part? Uber wide screen Tv and free NETFLIX! I loved this apartment. Don't hesitate to book."

She kept in contact with me to make sure everything was ok which was very thoughtful.  There was fresh roses in the apartment really lovely touch also lots of groceries like tea bags, coffee, milk etc. which was great after a long flight.  There are even bath robes and lovely fluffy towels The apartment is beautiful very luxurious, we loved it.  It's spotlessly clean, great TV, WIFI, everything you need and more. It's a great location. Very easy to walk around from and also Museum station is right on the door step. It was our first visit to Sydney and should we go back I would love to stay here again.  I can't thank Desiree enough. We were absolutely thrilled with it. Truly 5 star."

A perfectly stocked kitchen and tasty tea made it really homely. It was also spotless clean and the African styled furnishings gave it a memorable touch. The house has friendly reception staff and they were helpful with giving directions. The location is sublime as it overlooks Hyde Park which is really close to both parts of the city centre. We highly recommend the flat and would happily stay again in the future. Thanks!"

The hotel rooms get marked down for being dated in reviews on hotel sites, but this apartment certainly isn't.  It's centrally located: it has Darlinghurst's little strip of restaurants just around the corner, and central Sydney equally close in the other direction.  I was here for a week in March and it (unusually) rained every day, so the 60\" UHD Samsung smart TV with Netflix and Stan (Aussie streaming), as well as Apple TV, was particularly welcome, as was the small gym on the roof.  The pool was less useful, but would be great normally.  Desire\u00e9 is a very friendly host too.  Highly recommended."

It hosts beautiful city views, a quick 5 minute walk to Museum rail station, and a hop to great restaurants and nightlife. The apartment is tastefully decorated with art and books from adventurous travels; furnished and accessorized with absolutely everything that I could require, plus more. I was impressed at the Desire\u00e9's thoughtfulness in accommodating her guests needs. Such things as a kind welcome note. Petite chocolates, mini fresh milk packs in the fridge, expresso machine and every conceivable toiletry item one could need inside a bathroom cabinet. Discreetly rolled up extension cords so you never have to look for one to reach the wall socket to charge your digital devices. The bed was comfortable, where sprigs of fragrant lavender greeted us laid upon freshly rolled up towels. We loved our stay and highly recommend Desire\u00e9 as a host. She communicated well, was always polite and prompt with messaging all required information upon booking. There's no doubt why Desire\u00e9 has been voted as a super host. You will be delighted."

It is smartly decorated with comfortable furniture and lovely modern kitchen and bathroom.  There is a guest laundry in the building with coin operated machines and you can do a big wash and dry for $4 each.  The apartment is bright and airy and has a nice busy city outlook which we enjoyed.  You can certainly hear the buzz of the city around you but you are right in the CBD so that is to be expected and enjoyed.  The location is fantastic.  You can walk to just about everything in the city centre and trains and buses are only metres away if you want to get around more quickly or go further afield.  Very easy access from the airport by train into Museum station. The host, Desiree, was a pleasure to deal with, excellent communication all the way through.  This is a wonderful little home away from home putting you right into centre of the Sydney action."

The unit was close to grocery, public transport and amenities were as if I had lived there.

You are also on subway routes too!\n\nThe home is quiet even though the street and park are well used.  It feels super safe to walk in.\n\nThere are great grocery and restaurant options right here...and we were hooked on Greenhouse Coffee just a few blocks down to start our day. We enjoyed the Sydney Festival and walked to their events and free activities. \n\nThe home had lots of lovely touches and thoughtful additions in the bath, the kitchen and a nice collection of books and info."

I came for the Sydney Film Festival, and the apartment was well located on Hyde Par, so I could walk to and from the venue. The studio was very comfortable and well stocked too - the little things such as tea, milk, spreads for breakfast etc were thoughtful. Picking up and dropping off the keys were a breeze and whilst I did not meet my host, she was very responsive and helpful. I can highly recommend this place for a city based jaunt. Thanks again Desiree"

The double glazing in the bedroom and super comfy bed meant we slept like a log, and the rest of the apartment is stylish and very comfortable.

We stayed with our toddler, and the building/apartment has excellent pram accessibility. "

He was also very responsive to additional questions. The residence service at the counter was also good and the blokes were helpful. The apartment is clean and spacious, although it could do with a couple of extra basic necessities particularly in the kitchen. \r\n\r\nHowever, two main things made this experience rather average instead of great.\r\n- I reserved a flat with TWO bedrooms and only got one. I complained and they relocated me to a bigger apartment with two separate beds, but still ONE bedroom.  Upon booking make sure to confirm its two bedrooms you sign up to.\r\n\r\n- Saturday seemed to be national construction day which meant 8am rise and shine. sunday there was activity too although less loud. Normally not a problem but not great when you experienced some of the Istanbul night life the night before. A notice about this at least would have been great."

Non corrisponde alle foto, perch\u00e8 le stanze da letto sono molto pi\u00f9 piccole di quello che appaiono, piene di suppellettili polverose e in disordine. Il sofa bed \u00e8 praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci \u00e8 stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno \u00e8 una latrina minuscola tanto \u00e8 vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perch\u00e9 non c'\u00e8 neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro. Veramente un comportamento deprecabile da parte sua."

Bathroom was very dirty with a broken toilet seat that was never fixed ...eventhough the staff was politely reminded each of the seven nights we stayed...holiday or no holiday...how can you be running a place like that? AC wasnt functioning, however, it was fixed by the end of second night and a fan provided as a replacement. In the end, it was exceptional as a budget place. I would highly suggest that the management take cleaning and basic hygeine into serious consideration (mold on the bathroom wall) the place could earn a 4 star experience with ease. "

Since I was traveling alone, I was given a room enough for a single traveler. The room in the listing is probably the room beside mine. Anyway it is not a big deal. I would still definitely stay here in the future. Thanks Mehmet!"

Mehmit's place is the whole package and experience.  Well worth it and a good price."

Her place is very clean and cozy! I absolutely loved the bedroom, the bed was very comfortable. Cheer was nice enough to let me drop off my bags earlier than check-in time so that I could go into the city for the day and was not bothered by me coming in and out late or early. She had everything I needed in the room including clean towels, cold water, a fan, books, and anything else I might need. The best part about her apartment was Mason the pup, he's VERY sweet! I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. Thank you Cheer! "

Cheer's dog was absolutely adorable. Above all, I appreciated the privacy I was able to have coupled with the hospitality. \n\nIf you're looking for a spot close to Manhattan, Cheer's place is a good choice. Cheer's spot is close to various subway and bus stops, making trips into the city very easy. There are also a variety of good restaurants in the area, as well as delicious street food. \n\nI would definitely recommend Cheer's place!"

Room was as advertised, neat and clean with nice touches (fresh towel, guidebooks, mini-fridge, candy). Shared bathroom was also clean. Check-in was very easy. Location and building are both quiet and safe, 15 minutes from LGA and walking distance to the subway (15-30 minutes to Manhattan). I highly recommend this listing. Thanks, Cheer."

I was happy to be a little bit outside of the center of the city, so that I could go home and relax in the evening - the neighborhood was surprisingly quiet for the city. The apartment is well connected to transit for going into Manhattan too, so I never had difficulty getting where I needed to go. Her dog was also really great and would often greet me at the door when I got home."

They also went above and beyond for their guests. On the day I was leaving, I locked myself out of the door when my luggage was still in the living room. Cheer ran back from work to unlock the door for me so I could get my luggage. I highly recommend this place to everybody!"

But Cheer was very helpful and accepted me as a guest. If you choose to stay with them, you are looking at a cozy bedroom well-stocked with basics like an electric kettle, a tiny fridge, water, tea bags, instant coffee sachets, creamer and sugar. So, there was no need to intrude their kitchen. Once you step out, you are welcomed to a melting pot of cultures. There are many inexpensive but good restaurants. The room was well-lit and comfortable. They really respect your privacy as well. I would definitely recommend you to stay with thffem."

The neighbourhood, very peaceful and about fifteen to thirty minutes drive from the JFK Airport, depending on traffic. Annette was available to describe to the cab driver just how to get to the apartment which was extremely useful considering my taxi was metered.\r\n\r\nI had been in the air for a total period of 22 hours so I thought I would just rest a little and then go out a-discovering the Queens neighbourhood, thanks to information already supplied by Annette, but the peace and basic comfort of the room and surroundings conspired to ensuring that I did not wake up until much later in the night when most shops were closed or near to closing."

Der war auch dringend notwendig, da es in New York im Juli sehr hei\u00df ist. Lane war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Da ich aber am n\u00e4chsten Tag schon um 5 am aus dem Haus bin, kann ich recht viel mehr auch nicht sagen. Die Nacht war ruhig und angenehm. Danke f\u00fcr die Gastfreundschaft, Lane!"

During our stay we didn't have much Interaktion with Lane and Annette though,  since we were gone exploring the city most of the time. The room was fine and just like depicted, but, as mentioned in previous comments, quite hot. The subway was only a short walk away, however, if there were constructions or delays, it sometimes took us over an hour to get into Manhatten - so just be aware of that. If you are planning to cook while in New York, I wouldn't necessarily recommend their place as the kitchen was rather poorly equipped and the cupboards above the stove were pretty greasy. Altogether: if you are just staying for a couple of nights and don't expect to be right at the edge of Manhatten, it's a good place to stay at. "

Our room was very simple and small but enough for two people (I would recommend to be careful around the corners of the bed). Althought there was a slight effort of communication between us and Anette, I didn't really feel that welcomed like with our previous hosts, which might have made me look little bit uneasy. There was also very big traffic around the single bathroom which took away little bit of our privacy. In any case the apartament title is not misleading. It was a very clean and comfortable stay.\r\n"

Our stay in New York is like staying in a new home away from home. We do not have issues on safety. The walk towards Union Turnpike Station is around 10mins from our place. Lane's place is highly recommended for tourists and travelers who needed a room to stay for their vacation."

In spite of this, Lane and her sister were very gracious ensuring we made it safely and welcoming us when we got there.

I was actually out and about pretty much the whole time from the moment I landed so I only dealt with Anette, but she was super friendly and pleasant. They keep their place clean and presentable so be sure to take your shoes off at the door! Their spot is in Jamaica, Queens and about an 8-10 min walk to the F and E trains at the Kew Gardens stop so it's super easy to get to and from the city and JFK. If you love NY pizza as much as I do, there's a spot not far from the trains on Queens Blvd right next to the McDonlads and a cafe as well as other eateries and shops. However, if you'd prefer to cook, they do have a kitchen, which I did not take advantage of. Again, I was out and about pretty much the whole time, but Lane's place is an excellent place if you need a clean bed and shower. Oh, and if I'm not mistaken I saw a Keurig, which I also did not take advantage of, but if you need some caffeine to start your day, then boom!"

The location is within walking distance from the Kew Gardens E/J Subway, and close to stores and fast food.  It is also right next to a major highway in Queens, which makes for easy road access.  The exact apartment is a bit hard to find so I recommend communications with Lane as the date of the stay gets closer so that she can help you find her place and coordinate your check-in.  The room is located in a third-floor apartment, and you need to use stairs to get there.  Lane is a fantastic host.  She is very responsive on email and helpful.  In all, I had a good experience because of the location and Lane's hospitality."

You're in NY so if you were planning on only staying in your room your entire trip then you'd be disappointed with the space because you get what you pay for...But like I said I was practically never there just to sleep or shower...Everyone was quiet and the place was clean...Not having AC was different since coming from Florida we always have the AC blasting but thankfully was cool enough to have the window and fan blowing. It's a decent place to keep your belongings as you explore the city."

Overall, great place to sleep for a night or two, would recommend it."

Rooms in the house were on separate ends making for more privacy. \nMy flight had been delayed multiple times, Vick was nice enough to allow my guest to check in without me. He and his sister, Maria were very fast in responding to our needs and even checking on us to make sure we were okay. \nDue to late flight departure, both Vick and Maria allowed later check out times to accommodate us. I would recommend this spot for small groups and I would love to stay here again! \nThanks so much! Trip successful! "

It's a big house with 10 large bedrooms, and common livingroom and large kitchen, deck (super nice) and bathrooms (3 bathroom area with individual shower (nice one), sink and toilet). I met nice people who gave me good advices to get around Sydney. David, the host, is very responsible and responded on the post to my emails while I was there. Being large, the house is very quiet and no one really bother anyone else. A cleaner shows up everyday, they were two ladies when I was there. They do an amazing job keeping the place spotless, and they are also very sweet. Now, Coggee is an amazing place. The house is up the street from the beach- there is also a large green park next to the beach. It's really nice. I went swimming at the ladies bath (sometype of sea water swimming pool on the beach) the first morning despite being Winter: amazing! I find that the picture showing Coggee beach do not make justice. It is so much more beautiful. I can't wait to go back there. (details: bus are down the street, Sydney downtown is 25min away, the airport is 20 min away (35$ for a cab), Bondi beach is 2 beaches away :p (20min), and peroquees are all around:)"

The basement light switches are on the pillar, situated at the bottom of the stairs on the left.  Our linen closet is filled with extra blankets and bed sheets. it is in the beige closet at the bottom of the basement stairs. 4 - If you use the microwave at the same time as the toaster or electric kettle, it will blow a fuse so try to remember not to do it. If it happens, no big deal, it can be switched back on through the electric panel in the basement. Voil\u00e0 ! i",

There's a 2persons bed, a build-in closet, another closet with drawers, a book case, a big desk, and a comfy sofa to relax on. Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the back yard, which Laura turned in a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). \r\n\r\nI've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. \r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood has everything you need. The house is near  shops, supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, parks (including the Mont Royal), several busstops, 2 metro stations (Laurier & Mont Royal; both 10 min walking distance), and there's and there's always some fun - often free - festival around the corner in the summer. Despite all this the street is actually really quiet and is very safe!\r\n\r\n"

Her place is in the BEST location, in the artistic area of Montr\u00e8al, very close to a bus station, grocery store, coffee shops, music bars and very good restaurants. The bedroom was so beautiful, clean, cosy and comfortable! I went to Montr\u00e8al on my own and I couldn't choose a better flat/area in the city. As a woman you can walk wherver you want feeling so confident and safe!!! \r\n\r\nThe whole apartment is so clean and beautiful! I got there just in time for good weather, and Laura was so nice to me, ready to answer to any question of myne, every time I needed, by phone and in person. We also had a lovely chat together in her fantastic courtyard and she invited me to her tasty birthday party introducing me all her friends. She has been great to me!\r\nIf you want to go to Montr\u00e8al, you absolutely have to go in her place!\r\n\r\n"

The resident kitty was possibly even more friendly than Laura, and will monopolize your whole stay with her adorableness if you let her. \r\n\r\nThe area is very close to bus routes, as well as some small coffee shops and restaurants, and of course the beautiful Mont Royale. The Mile-End neighborhood is eclectic and cute, with lots to see even if you're just wandering. \r\n\r\nI would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to friends headed to Montreal. "

She's very open minded and used to meeting different people all the time. There's no way you could be bored having her around. \nIf you're only visiting for a few days, she will definitely be a good adviser, she knows her city by heart. If you're staying longer like I did, the only risk is that you might have a heavy heart when it will be time to leave. \n"

There are so many great restaurants, caf\u00e9s and shops nearby (including a large supermarket a few minutes away) you are spoiled for choice. Mont-Royal metro station is only a 10 minute walk away to so you can be downtown in 25 minutes! "

The location of her place is ideal, surrounded by stores, cafes and restaurants and walking distance from other cool neighborhoods. There is close access to public transportation (metro and bus) and I was able to get to all the areas I wanted to visit very easily. The room is huge with a comfy bed, closet space, a big desk and a corner sofa. The rest of the apartment was clean and orderly and I felt really comfortable throughout my stay. I would definitely recommend staying at Laura's and I will certainly do so whenever I visit Montreal again!"

She is a very hospitable host and I felt at home during my 2 weeks stay. Milton (the cat) is super friendly but not annoying. Try to visit few of her local restaurants' recommendations, there are some great tips. Overall, this is one of the best airbnb accommodations in Mtl."

La casa \u00e8 posizionta tra i miei due quartieri in assoluto preferiti della citt\u00e0: Plateu e Mile End e bastano pochissimi giorni per sentirsi subito integrati nel quartiere come un vero Montrealese!! Meno di 10 minuti a piedi e si raggiunge la stazione della metropolitana Laurier e in meno di 15 minuti quella di Mont-Royal. Inoltre l'autobus 55 passa a un minuto a piedi da casa e ti porta in Downtown - old port in 20 minuti e in little italy in 15. Il quartiere \u00e8 pieno di caf\u00e8, gallerie d'arte, negozi vintage e bistro dove cenare o fare un brunch! E' davvero un luogo autentico.\nLilou \u00e8 un host fantastica.. e la sua gatta Milton \u00e8 molto dolce e simpatica.\nLa casa ha tutto ci\u00f2 che (Website hidden by Airbnb) cucina \u00e8 ben fornita e in taverna c'\u00e8 la lavatrice e l'asciugatrice che si pu\u00f2 utilizzare liberamente."

To stay in this airbnb, you definitely need to be OK with cats, since the very friendly black cat who lives there considers herself the true owner. The bed was excellent, the kitchen very practical, the laundry machines in the basement easy to use, and Lilou herself is very friendly and welcoming and helpful."

The location was awesome, as it was one street off of St. Laurent (a street with many neat shops and restos) and a 10 minute walk to the metro. It was also a short walk to the Mile End where the delicious bagels are. Although it was crazy hot outside, the apartment and bedroom were still very cool. The bedroom was large and the bed was super comfy. 10/10 would recommend and stay again!"

Super hip neighborhood, a beautiful park not too far away and so many lovely shops/cafes, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into. There was a grocery store across the street and lots of bus stops nearby. The metro was only a 7-10 minute walk away. It\u2019s ground level, so it makes traveling with large luggage bags pretty easy. Milton, the cat, was friendly and gentle. Laura made excellent company as well. About as close to a perfect host you could get; never too overbearing and yet great to make conversation with. The room was bigger than I thought it was going to be! Even though Montreal is hot and humid it was never uncomfortable, the fan provided in the room did the trick for me. There were a couple instances where the door was locked from the inside, but it was never a huge problem. Laura was easy to get in contact with and surprisingly quick to reply, no matter what time of day it was. It didn\u2019t make my stay any less incredible. The price is right and I cannot recommend this place enough! "

Es gibt einige Gaststaetten und kleine Superm\u00e4rkte in der N\u00e4he.\r\nDie Ausstattung des Appartements ist sehr gut - 1 Hauptbad und 1 kleines separates, komplette K\u00fcche, TV in Wohnzimmer und Schlafzimmer, etc. Es ist wie auf den Fotos bei Airbnb dargestellt. Die Fotos haben dabei infolge der Beleuchtung einen leichten Gelbton. Im Original ist alles etwas heller.\r\nMir hat es gefallen hier zu uebernachten, da ich im Urlaub keine Hotels m\u00f6chte"

Lovely, clean and quiet accommodation, welcoming host and many little things that made the experience enjoyable. \r\n\r\nAs an AirBnB newbie, I wasn't really sure on the protocols for communicating etc. However, Tracy made me feel relaxed and at home. She has a gorgeous, friendly dog and the place is immaculate - she had also left some fresh fruit, juice and water which was super-welcome after arriving on a fairly late flight. All the linens, towels etc were of high quality, and the shower is fantastic!  No air-con, but it's a shady spot and the fan was fine, even on two warm summer evenings.\r\n\r\nIf you are in Narrabeen to stay for any length of time, I can highly recommend this as your perfect home away from home."

Could have stayed by the pool all day! \r\nThere was a lovely selection of teas and some Orange Juice and fruit. While I didn't use much of the kitchen utensils - looked like there was everything you needed to make a nice meal if you were staying longer or wanted to cook.\r\nThe location is beautiful - easy to walk by Narrabeen lake. Tracy was very flexible and welcoming and easy to communicate with. A very easy experience overall.\r\n"

Milk in the fridge, pantry items, umbrellas, torches, high quality toiletries, Foxtel, wifi etc.  Beautiful flowers and plants to make the area brighter, surrounded by greenery to make your stay feel private and like a retreat.  Lovely artwork and beach themed decor to make the place feel like home at the beach.\n\nLots of off road parking and a very safe area to go for walks and enjoy the lake.  Highly recommend."

We loved having Sari pop by (the lovely vizsla) from time to time. Tracy is such a great host. She is always willing to help out or let you know what\u2019s happening in the area. It was so convenient to borrow the bikes and ride to the rock pool or any of the beaches along the coast. Tracy\u2019s place is a gem. We will definitely come back some time."

He was very responsive to our communication and helpful in providing direction once our flight landed.  He even provided us with the written directions in Cantonese in case our taxi driver didn\u2019t speak English (which came in very handy!).\r\n\r\nRicky had his cousin meet us at a College which was 10 minutes from the airport.  His cousin was very friendly and helpful \u2013 he even arrived with a cart to carry our bags to the apartment.   As there are no vehicles that directly access Ricky\u2019s neighbourhood, there was a lovely 5 minute walk on a beautiful path which weaved through the jungle.  \r\n\r\nUpon arrival at Ricky\u2019s building, it was clear that the place was very clean and well kept.  He provided us with some water bottles, offered us dinner, and his 2 friendly cats entertained us while he checked us in.  He proceeded to show us the rooftop terrace which is a great spot to hang out and enjoy the view of the mountains.  There is also an area to wash and hang dry your laundry up there.\r\n\r\nThe room appeared to be recently renovated.  It was small, but it was very clean and efficiently laid out.  There was good A/C to keep cool as well as a TV with some basic cable for some entertainment.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a perfect place nearby the airport to spend the night before continuing our travels.  The price was fair, and I would highly recommend staying here. \r\n\r\n"

The village is a bit off of the main road, but they were waiting for us when we arrived with a cart that we could load all of our luggage on to and they brought it to the residence for us. They did the same thing for us super early in the morning and had taken care of making sure a cab was waiting for us to take us to the airport. They also gave us a ride to the train station after we first arrived to make our night much easier. It was super short notice, and a super short trip but they went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of."

I find it perfect for a weekend to get out of the city and enjoy nature! \r\nRicky and Terry are great hosts! They were very helpful with the pick-up, check-out and suggestions for getting around. We took a hike to Tai O and really enjoyed it. \r\nI highly recommend this place if you like nature, hiking and to see another side of Hong Kong. \r\n"

They live in a village that is surrounded by fruit trees and rain forest...very nice! Ricky and his cousin are most helpful. They even drove me to the MTR for breakfast! Will definitely stay again if I'm venturing back this way."

We have no difficulty locating their guest house because Ricky provided us with precise instruction and they even picked us up at the bus terminal. The guest house is very clean and tidy. Good wifi connectivity. It is located in a village far from city centre so the air is extremely fresh and environment is very quiet and serene. You can get a good nice sleep here."

Searched AirBnb since hotels were very expensive and found Ricky's place with late notice and booked it quickly. His place is about 10 minutes from the HK airport and his cousin met us where the taxi dropped us off. He was very nice and moved our suitcases for us on a trolley he brought. The place is a private room on the side like it's your own place. Has everything you need for a quick rest. He even woke up in the early morning 630am to help us trolley our luggage to the taxi area and called a taxi for us. Very friendly and a great host. Would stay again."

Ricky was able to pick us up for a small charge, which I would highly recommend since it otherwise would be difficult to find this property if you are not familiar with the area.\n\nWe woke up the first day and Ricky and his colleague provided us with maps and directions in both English and Cantonese. Furthermore, they gave us a walking tour around the property as well as highlighted all the main attractions in and around their area. \n\nI would also recommend this property to anyone who is interested in going to Hong Kong Disneyland as it has a close proximity to the Metro Station and local bus routes. \n\nAll in all, Ricky and his friend were very friendly, professional, and informative. They spoke very clear English and were very helpful in both providing us with extremely personalized customer service. Again, I would highly recommend this property to anyone. "

The apartment is tiny - especially for two american size people. The listing is accurate i just think i forgot what a double sized bed means. If you are arriving late - eat dinner before you go. There didnt seem to be any dining in the village. The scenery was very quaint! The apartment was clean!"

If you love the outdoors, you will enjoy the scenic walk from the main road to their home. But if you're not into long walks, this is not the listing for you."

        "comments": "I had about a 10 hour layover in Hong Kong, so my boyfriend and I needed a clean, affordable place to crash. Our flight arrived at 11:45pm and left the next day at 10:15am. Ricky was great about communicating with me from beginning to end. He answered all my questions super fast! Even though I had a somewhat late arrival, his cousin Terry met us and had a dolly for our luggage. His place is like this hidden oasis. You take this cool walk through all these fruit trees. It looks like a forest! It's off the beaten path, but that's what adds to it's charm and appeal. When you get to his place, it's quiet and you feel like you're away from the hustle and bustle, but you're really not. \n\nThe room that we stayed in had a separate entrance from the house, so it was like we had our own apartment,  minus the kitchen. My boyfriend and I each had a backpack and a carry on suitcase. The room was a bit tight for us and our stuff, but it was manageable. It was clean, cozy and comfortable. It had all the amenities you would need...towels, soap, shampoo, comfy and clean bed, heat or AC (which we didn't use), safe place, and privacy. The room was just what we needed. We had our own bed and restroom. It was clean and it was close to the airport. Plus, there's wifi! Since I arrived kind of late, I texted Ricky about the wifi and he got back to me right away! \n\nThen, on our departure day, Terry had arranged a taxi for us and saw us off. It was like VIP service without the VIP price.  Overall, you can't go wrong by booking with Ricky and Terry. These guys know what they're doing. Their place is just what you need...if it's for one night or more...you'll get great hosts with a great place to stay. Don't wait...just book with them! "

Ricky and his cousin worked everything out perfectly. From meeting us at the pickup point (with a rolling cart for outlet bags) to arranging a cab to pick us up for our departure, the communication was excellent. We were told all about the town and some great recommendations for close places to visit and eat. I would highly recommend staying here, either for a close place by the airport between flights or for a few days to explore. \n\nThanks for everything, \nAbby & Jae \n"

The area at the top of the house had breathtaking views and it was lovely to be able to sit up there in the evenings enjoying the view and relaxing with drinks after doing all the touristic  sights,\nIt was an absolute pleasure for us to be guests at rickys place."

Beautiful spot out of the hustle bustle excellent links to public transport.  Excellent hosts who went out of the way to help.  Met us from the taxi drop off point early morning and took us back to the accommodation, lots of handy hints and information about the area and local transport and after initial check in always available if needed."

Unbelievable hospitality from Terry who walked us back to the apartment, showed us around, made sure we were comfortable and gave us tips on the best way to get to the airport in the morning. Not to forget about the place, very clean, updated, comfortable.. everything you need. And the rooftop hangout is beautiful, the girl and I had a romantic dinner and Terry even offered us a candle (I thought he was kidding haha so sweet) can't say enough about the place and the guys!

Place is super convenient in terms of getting to the airport - just a 10 min taxi drive and then some 10 min walk. Ricky\u2019s cousin Terry met us at the taxi drop off point, offered a cart for our bags and even pushed it himself to the apartments. In the morning Terry ordered a taxi for us and also carried our bags on a cart. \n\nThe room is neat and cozy. Overall a lovely experience"

Terry picked me up from the street to show me the way to the guesthouse, which I would have never found alone for the first time, but not hard to find after that.  He also gave tips on where to visit around the area. I would recommend this to someone who wants to get away from the busy city for a while!"

We had a flight from the US that arrived at 6pm and wanted to spend our first night in Hong Kong near the airport before we moved to central Hong Kong and this was PERFECT! The rooftop was so beautiful- so many plants and what a view. We could hear so much wildlife and it was relaxing. The room was sparkling clean and exactly what we needed. \n\nRicky gave us so many wonderful recommendations. The place would be a bit challenging to find your first time so he had his cousin, terry, meet us. Terry was also incredibly friendly and told us where to go to eat. \n\nWe loved Lantau Island and explored Tai O and Big Buddha the next day before heading to Hong Kong. I\u2019m so glad we did this. \n\nThanks!!!"

However, it is within easy walking distance of transportation and amenities in the city. It\u2019s quite different from the usual Hong Kong experience - calm and peaceful and relaxing. The rooms are small but very clean, comfortable and newly remodeled.  Ricky and Terry were both very helpful and accommodating and provided tips about getting around. One thing to keep in mind is that you cannot reach the location by automobile as there is no vehicular road to the site, so plan accordingly."

The employees at the security gate were always very friendly and the property was very well kept.  Ray was always very quick to respond, especially when we were concerned about the 2 hurricanes that were headed toward the islands.  Luckily we were hardly affected on our side of the island.  Right at the bottom of the street from the condo was a beautiful beach for snorkeling.  All of the directions and instructions for the condo were easy to follow and it was very easy to find it's location. If you're looking to get away from the chaos of Honolulu and Waikiki, this place and part of the island is great."

        "comments": "This place is a little slice of heaven. It is everything their ad says and more. It really is about as far removed from the Honolulu tourist bustle as one can get. This is a huge bonus to experience Hawaii and a place to live and enjoy the people and untouched beaches along the Waianae Coast.  The Waianae Harbor is just down the road and is where many people from the Waikiki hotels get bused an hour to board the boats to go out for turtle and dolphin cruises.  But, you will be right there! The condo tower community is much more resort like than other condos (minus a restaurant on property), but with the many local restaurants nearby you will never get bored with the eating out options. The condo in modern with all the essential elements. The bathroom is large, the bed is comfy. This is one of the rare units with a screen front door so you can open it up to enjoy a cross breeze if desired and not get attacked by mosquitoes. The view is fantastic. Laundry is just down the hall. I highly recommend Ray and Lise's place!\n\nA word about Handicap Access: If you are handicap and need to avoid stairs, be sure to bring your handicap placard from your car so they give you a special pass to park in the resident parking. I have a bum knee so stairs are not my friend. The standard visitor parking in on the lowest level and is a bit of a hike and many stairs which is no issue for most travelers. There are no handicap parking stalls; all are on a first come basis so if you get back late at night, parking can be a challenge, but you can still avoid stairs by walking in a different door/elevator and making your way to the condo. The pool is three flights of stairs down; no elevator options. But, if you drive your car around to the pool there is a ramp up to the BBQ area to eliminate most of the stairs but you will still have about 10 steps up yo the pool to deal with. Unfortunately there is no wheelchair access to the pool.  "

It is a pleasure having breakfast facing the ocean and mountain view at morning. the king size bed is very comfortable, and the sofa can be use to sleep alternatively, making the condo be a real suite deluxe.They support abundant appliance for snorkeling and beach playing. The porperty have impressive security system, living there is safe and quiet. And  if you have car, the location is not the problem. Acturally,  I always think the location of the porperty, which is at the west side of Oahu,  is like the heaven at the end of the world. This is my first Airbnb experience, and it is very great and miraculous, even when my family leave the condo at the last day, we saw 6 beautiful peacocks standing beside the driving road seeing us off. Thank you, Ray and Lise, for your homelike accomodation and warm welcome. I wish to come back to your house in future."

Ray and Lise\u2019s condo is an excellent choice for travellers who are not afraid to get away from the tourist hotspots and are willing and able to drive back and forth to the sights that you want to see.  The beaches on this side of the island are unreal! You have to see them to believe them.  Specifically Ray and Lise\u2019s condo is very comfortable, with all amenities and a comfy bed.  We spent a lot of our days either touring the island or at the beach so we were very glad to have a comfy condo with Cable Tv to come home to in the evening.  \nThe views are spectacular!  The kitchen is well appointed and we cooked almost all our meals at the condo, or down at the bbq area. The pool area is very well kept, clean and quiet.  The grounds on the property are very pretty.  We experienced no noise issues while we were there.  The staff at this facility are very very friendly and we had no issues with checking in and getting around the property.  \nRay and Lise have beach chairs, coolers and umbrellas, snorkelling gear and books for their guests to use as needed. This was very helpful for us when we spent time at the beaches!\nRay and Lise\u2019s communication throughout the booking process and leading up to the trip was impeccable. They answered all questions i had and were very quick to offer advise for our stay.  We knew exactly what to expect and were not caught off guard by anything when we arrived at their condo.  \nOverall this place is 5/5 for us and it was an experience we will never forget."

He personally greeted me, recommended some restaurants (I went to one and had amazing sushi) and showed patiently how the pool and refrigerator work. The apartment looks even better than on the pictures. I especially loved the rooftop with 360 view. I really had a good chance to relax and unwind in Cesars place. One thing to mention is that the apartment has a great energy all round, I would highly recommend it to anyone. "

The reason I came back is because besides marvelous view and the setup the place has this amazing energy which is especially rejuvenating after a stressful work period back in NYC. Wherever you are in the apartment your eyes are almost constantly facing the green if the trees, water and the Christo statue in the background which is very relaxing. \n\nDuring my starving was around 35C in Rio so I spend a good time in the pool which is very deep, clean and enjoyable. Tivesse so good I barely went to the gym which is literally minutes away. \n\nCesar was super kind, he is definitely not your regular Airbnb host. As he knows I like to cook potatoes he showed me how to cook Mandioca Brazilian potatoes with shrimps. It was an unforgettable cooking and gastronomic experience. \n\nI will certainly come back again next time I am in Ipanema. "

The views are far more incredible than the photos. Swimming in a private pool overlooking the Christ statue was truly remarkable. And of course, the hospitality demonstrated by Cesar and Ana was terrific."

Overlooking Christ the Redeemer and the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, the apartment had spectacular views. Breakfast was served on weekdays, the apartment was sparkly clean, the small private pool was a special treat after exploring the city, and the views were one I won't forget. Conveniently located in Ipanema, the apartment is walking distance to grocery stores, world class restaurants, and beautiful beaches. Cesar was an incredibly kind host. He left us snacks on arrival and shared with us a cake upon departure. A truly kind spirit. The hardest part was leaving. Would love to return one day. Saudades!"

Das Apartment liegt wie auf den Fotos erkennbar zur hinteren Seite, sodass wir von dem munteren Leben auf der wirklich sch\u00f6nen Rua das Flores innerhalb der Wohnung nichts mitbekommen haben. Andreia f\u00fchrte uns bei der Begr\u00fc\u00dfung nach oben und zeigte uns die R\u00e4umlichkeiten, welche den Eindruck best\u00e4tigen, der durch die Fotos entstanden ist: F\u00fcr einen Kurztrip, wo ihr die meiste Zeit des Tages au\u00dferhalb verbringt. In der Parallelstra\u00dfe \u00fcberhalb der Rua das Flores befindet sich ein Supermarkt an dem wir uns mit dem n\u00f6tigsten an Verpflegung f\u00fcr unseren Aufenthalt ausstatten konnten. Dar\u00fcber hinaus gab uns Andreia viele Tipps zur Freizeitgestaltung in Porto. S\u00e4mtliche Anziehungspunkte sind aufgrund der zentralen Lage super einfach und in der Regel innerhalb von 10 - 15 Minuten Fu\u00dfmarsch zu erreichen. An der angrenzenden Station Sao Bento f\u00e4hrt auch die Buslinie 500, welche euch in ca. 40 Minuten zum Stadtstrand in Matosinhos bringt. Wir haben die vier Tage in Porto sehr genossen und netterweise k\u00fcmmerte sich Andreia am letzten Tag sogar noch darum, dass wir unser Gep\u00e4ck nach dem Checkout sicher f\u00fcr ein paar Stunden verstauen konnten. Ich kann dieses Apartment nur w\u00e4rmstens weiter empfehlen!"

The apartment had a nice little balcony where you can eat breakfast, it looks over a courtyard that has the occasional tour group. It's super quiet, very easy to get to and Andreia is absolutely wonderful. She was around to answer any questions we had and had left a nice guide to the city, along with a map. \nWe can really only say good things about it!"

Despite the central location, we had no issues with noise at night. The apartment was very clean and accurately reflected in the pictures. It served our purposes very well. Because we visit in the winter, the apartment was slightly cold, but Andreia provided an additional heater which was enough. \n\nAndreia was also very responsive to our requests and issues. We even allowed us to store our luggage at her workplace after our check out, which was so nice of her. \n\nOverall, would highly recommend the apartment complex!"

A not\u00e9 l'emplacement id\u00e9al en face de l'arr\u00eat De m\u00e9tro Sao Bento et en face de la magnifique gare. \nLe logement m'a sembl\u00e9 tr\u00e8s bien isol\u00e9 car en plus de ne pas entendre les voisins la temp\u00e9rature int\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait id\u00e9ale au vue de la chaleur dehors. \n\nJe vous recommande ce logement vivement !

De locatie, pal tegenover het centraal station S\u00e3o Bento, is ideaal. Van hieruit is de stad goed te ontdekken, zowel te voet als per bus/metro/trein. \n\nAndreia is een fijne Airbnb hostes. Ze reageert snel op berichten en denkt goed mee. Zo waren wij 's ochtends al vroeg gearriveerd in Porto en zaten we met onze bagage. Eigenlijk konden we pas om 15:00 uur inchecken, maar van Andreia heeft ervoor gezorgd dat we de bagage al konden droppen in het appartement. \n\nWij hebben een superfijne tijd gehad! En echte aanrader voor eenieder die Porto wil leren kennen en ontdekken!"

The communication with Andreia was very good. Our plane was late and we arrived after 12 pm, it was no problem to check in. The only thing that was a little bit disturbing was a building site directly next to us. We weren't told about it and it was very loud all day from 8 am to 5 pm."

        "comments": "Avid Airbnb-ers, we have stayed in some remarkable places, but this was by far the best. And the fact that it was a 5 minute drive from Volcano park was the icing on the cake. Mike is a real gentleman, informative, kind, and easy to contact. We will not forget the cherished experience he afforded. \n\n\nWe particularly enjoyed the cabin's  rare blend of rustic charm and meticulously maintained, modern elegance. The beautiful wood interior with exposed beams, light scent of cedar, old-fashioned fireplace, and free-standing antique tub, all made the cabin incredibly charming. The wrap-around porch was not only scenic, but very quiet and mosquito free. It was a wonderful place to chat in the evenings, read selections from the bookshelf, and to enjoy the delicious breakfast items provided, including fresh papaya. Since the cabin resides at the end of the residential area, the only thing visible for miles from the back porch was lush, pristine forest. The cabin's enveloping sense of privacy was relaxing and romantic. \n\nWith respect to the cabin's modern appeal, where does one begin? Even the toaster lowered the bread automatically. One can enjoy coffee prepared by three different methods, including French press, and Mike made sure we had ample amounts of freshly ground coffee. The stainless steel fridge was packed with complementary goodies as well. Being expert snackers, we were quite pleased. \n\nThis understood, the modern conveniences went far beyond food. We enjoyed being able to dim the lights just the right amount in each room to create the desired ambiance. The king-sized bed in the loft was incredibly comfortable and featured three types of pillows, including a memory foam option. But the aspect of our stay we liked the most had to do with the modern architecture of the cabin itself. The walls of the A-frame design, both behind the bed and in front of it, feature large windows with breathtaking views of the forest. As a result, the typical distinction between interior and exterior does not apply. The effect was magical. Waking up in the morning, we were in awe. \n\nThanks again for everything, Mike. "

By far the best experience I've had using Airbnb. I accidentally left my charger and he mailed it out the next day. Would absolutely recommend and will definitely be staying there again!"

Mike didn't miss a single detail--truly! There were maps to navigate the vast expanse of the Big island's Volcano park; filtered water by the bedside; beautiful Hawaiian music playing from the Bluetooth speaker; local coffee & produce; headlamps to use in the volcano caves, etc (*this list is far more extensive). \r\n\r\nMike had a warmth about him you could immediately feel--and not the, 'I feel obliged to be pleasant', but a feeling of true hospitality and generosity. I live on Oahu and will certainly rent from Mike again in the near future!   "

Its totally private, with acres of Hawaiin jungle surrounding it. \n\nWe could not believe how modern the house was. In Hawaii, a lot of the houses are older and they have outdated furniture. This house was modern with beautiful furniture, gorgeous floors, and beautiful bathtub/sinks/counters. There are so many windows. There is an L-shaped wrap around deck that is massive. We spent almost all of our time sitting out there on the comfortable patio furniture, listening to the jungle, drinking our freshly prepared 100% Hawaiin coffee that our host provided. (Also, we didnt get a single mosquito bite. We never even saw any.) \n\nSpeaking of what the host provided for us: coffee, tea, oats, pancake mix, butter, sugar, syrup, fresh jam, eggs, orange juice, milk, chocolate, yogurt, and fruit. We were amazed. \n\nEvery detail of this house, each room, is modern, cozy and designed to make you feel like you are on a luxurious vacation. This place is 5 stars. We wished we'd known how awesome it was going to be, and stayed more than one night."

The owner, Mike, was prompt and thorough with all communications and incredibly informative about directions, dining recommendations, and local attractions. His love of not only the cabin, but the local community and environment was evident in every facet of our stay. From the locally grown coffee, fresh baked banana bread, and organic whole milk to the unique iron claw bath tub, cozy cotton bath robes, and natural rainwater supply, every nook and cranny of this endearing cabin reflected Mikes attention to detail and reverence for nature. This true getaway will bring total relaxation secluded in a rain forest where the pitter-patter of rain on a tin roof will lull you into a deep sleep only to awaken the next morning to the cool crisp air echoing with exotic bird calls. Best AirBnB experience that I have had yet! "

Die Lage, die Ausstattung, die Sauberkeit, bequemes Bett, alles hat gestimmt. \nMike ist sehr f\u00fcrsorglich und er hat die Cabin liebevoll eingerichtet. Man sp\u00fcrt, dass es ihm wichtig ist, dass die G\u00e4ste sich wohl f\u00fchlen (mehrere Blumengestecke, kuscheliger Morgenmantel)). Er hat zur Ben\u00fctzung ausf\u00fchrliche Instruktionen gegeben (Papaya zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck schon vorbereitet) und war bei Fragen  erreichbar.  \nPreislich ist die Cabin eher im oberen Segment, aber f\u00fcr eine kleine Ferien-H\u00fctte am Rand vom Naturschutztreservat mit Blick auf den wilden Urwald mit all seinen Annehmlichkeiten eigentlich unbezahlbar.\nEs kann bisweilen ziemlich k\u00fchl sein auf 1000 Fuss (?m), gegen Mittag f\u00e4ngt es auch h\u00e4ufig zu nieseln / regnen an. Hatte h\u00e4ufig meine Daunenjacke an, Heizungsl\u00fcfter w\u00e4re bei Bedarf vorhanden. Ich habe 2 N\u00e4chte gebucht. Mit allem was es im Vulkanpark zu sehen gibt,  k\u00f6nnte man durchaus auch noch l\u00e4nger da verweilen. \n\nZus\u00e4tzlich ist Mike als erfahrener \"Seeb\u00e4r\" (eigenes Schiff) darauf bedacht, dass auch Kleinigkeiten stimmen, die einem das Leben erleichtern ( hawaianische Musik ab MP3 Player, grosse Bibliothek \u00fcber Hawaii ( Pflanzen, Tiere, Geschichtevetc etc). Er hat zudem ein grosses Wissen \u00fcber einheimische Pflanzen und Tiere, die er einem gerne weitergibt.\nEr geht praktisch jeden Morgen zum Vulkan. Er hat mich spontan um 05 30 fr\u00fchmorgends zum \"glow\"  mitgenommen (leuchten der Magma, am besten b Sonnen auf oder -Untergang sichtbar). Danach haben wir in der Milit\u00e4r- basis im Park gefr\u00fchst\u00fcckt und \u00fcber \"Gott ind die Welt\" gesprochen. \nThanks for all that, dear Mike. I appreciated my stay a lot. It was wonderfull!"

If you're looking at other places, trust me when I tell you that you have found the perfect place in the Flying Cloud Cabin. I don't think I have enough space to really describe just how awesome of an experience Mike helped us have, but I'll definitely try.\r\n\r\nThe location is fantastic, and about as close as you can be to Volcano park without actually staying inside it. We were able to easily make our way to some of the most remote locations of the park without having to worry about when we would get back to the cabin. \r\n\r\nThe amenities were beyond belief. Mike provided a warm in-person greeting despite our late night arrival, and had just about everything ready that you could imagine. The fridge was well stocked with juice, jams, eggs, fruit, and a few other tasty treats ready for us to consume. He gave us a quick tour around, made sure we had an answer to all our questions, and even had two wonderfully fuzzy robes ready for us.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know what to do in Volcano, don't worry! Mike has great recommendations of what to do anywhere on the island, and gave us great ideas for where to go inside the park and around volcano as well.\r\n\r\nIf this hasn't convinced you already, I'm not sure what will. This is hands down the best place I have ever stayed. Come here, have a wonderful time, and enjoy!"

He decorated it with amazing iterior and mardern electric facilities.\r\nOf course, Mike himself is the point. He's so kind and was waiting for us in the raining evening even we were a little bit late. he shows us aroung the place and all free food and fruits prepared for us. Especially he show me his cool boat picture cause he knew me as a sailer. But I should say Mike is a sailing master cause he crossed Pacific for 3 times.\r\nMike gave us a very important suggestion that we'd better to observ the Lawa at night time even we just arriveed. Then we had a truelly impressive outlook at the top os Kilauea and took photoes over the night, incluing Starry Night Sky and Milky Way.\r\nNow it comes the sunny morning but we shoule leave. If I will be back to Volcano, I defenitely will contact with Mike and stay here as longer as possible.\r\nMuch appreciate, dear Mike, you gave us a wonderful wedding ceremony stay. \r\n\u590f\u5a01\u5937\u4e4b\u65c5\u5370\u8c61\u81f3\u6df1\u7684\u4e00\u665a!  \u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u6781\u9ad8!\r\n"

My wife and I stayed for 4 nights during our honeymoon and absolutely loved it. This gave us enough time to explore VNP, drive to Kalapana and bike to the lava flow, and to just relax and enjoy the cabin. \n\nThe location is perfect. It's less than 10 minutes from the entrance of the park and we found ourselves going early in the morning to beat the crowd and after dark to see the volcano glow from the Jagger Museum. The cabin is completely secluded but only a short drive from the highway. Just over the highway there are several restaurants and convenience stores. We really enjoyed dinner at the Kilauea Lodge. \n\nThe cabin itself is beautiful and charming. Mike has thought of absolutely everything and was very attentive to any needs we had. We could see the sunrise from our bed and on a clear night we could see the moon and stars. The cabin can be chilly at night and the area can get cold and rainy, so pack accordingly. One night we took advantage of the fireplace which was great. \n\nMike was the best airbnb host I've had and we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. "

Mike was a warm, helpful, thoughtful host, and every detail of the cabin was amazing. It smelled good walking into it--from the cedar it's made of--and everything inside was immaculate. The photos of the cabin itself don't do justice to the space, the light, the furniture, the attention to detail.\r\n\r\nMike answered my numerous questions via email quickly and thoroughly, left lots of delicious food for us (yogurt, granola, fresh fruit, pumpkin bread, bagels, wonderful juices), and offered great advice about what to see and do. (Don't miss the Volcano farmer's market if you're there on a Sunday morning.)\r\n\r\nIt's a luxury to have the half-bathroom upstairs in addition to the full one downstairs. The bed was super comfortable. Mike had thought of everything: binoculars, umbrellas, flashlights, guidebooks. The cabin was spacious and cozy at once. I cannot recommend this place more highly.\r\n"

The cabin is just a short drive from Volcano National Park, which made is easy for us to pop over multiple times to see the lava and other attractions both during the day and at night. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of restaurants nearby in Volcano Village, and a small convenience store for buying food. Mike provides a really nice spread for breakfast though (we had eggs, granola, yogurt, fresh papaya, english muffins, local spreads and jams, and a myriad of other things to fill us up), so chances are you won't need to buy much. Mike even dropped off a warm loaf of pumpkin bread one morning!\r\n\r\nMike seems to have thought of everything you could possibly need while at his place - he has binoculars, headlamps and maps available for trips to the park, lots of blankets to keep you warm, and he even offered to start a fire for us. His cabin is lovely, and bigger than it appears in the photos. This is the perfect place to stay if you want a romantic spot to relax and check out the volcano. \r\n\r\n"

        "comments": "Mike is a delightfully pleasant and affable host with an almost heavenly place in the clouds you get the pleasure of sharing for a while. There are so many things to say here, but I'll just focus on the two most important and overarching areas of interest: the host and the home. The most accurate description I can relinquish of this host (Mike) is that he was kind, organized, informed, and impressively meticulous in his attention to detail. We actually ran into him by coincidence while out hiking the VNP trails and we were glad to share in part of a hike with him to have the chance to get to know him better. Our brief Mike-guided tour was just a nice bonus as he is an admirable conversationalist with an interesting life and is very knowledgeable of the VNP area. We have personally ranked him as our overall best host in all of our AirBnB stays to date, and that is saying a lot as we have been very fortunate to have nearly all positive experiences via AirBnB. Albeit, Mike sets the bar really high; the previous makes sense given he basically lives in the clouds in the shadow of a volcano. The home was incredible and in retrospect remains our favorite place we stayed this year on the islands of Hawaii and Maui (out of 7 other homes and/or hotels). Mike has obviously placed a lot of consideration into this offering and continues to build upon a rock solid foundation of thoughtful hosting. He easily supplies every utensil, comfort, amenity, and convenience you could expect and/or want in this upscaled cabin. There are all the expected and unexpected kitchen fixings, a small library in a large wall-shelf filled with Hawaii-centric materials, several dehumidifiers, music and lighting that just delivers a very creature-comfort cabin experience, and a slew of other add-ons provided to make life just a little easier on your trip. The interior of this house has so many fine things it's hard to list but our personal favorites were the 100-year old clawfoot tub (also functions as a standing shower), the tempur-pedic bed and ultra comfortable bedding, and last but not least the carefully selected combinations of wood all throughout the house, which make it feel like it's both somewhere old and somewhere new to its guest as well as blends the home into its earthy and forested setting just outside the glass doors. The lanai wraps around the unit and makes for an amazingly tranquil place to eat a meal or listen and watch the rain. The surrounding area is residential but spread out and Mike's place seems like it's in own little universe, tucked between the trees. We found the flying cloud was easy to find (via GPS) and an absolutely perfect spot for those looking to enjoy the VNP as its very close (<10mins) and makes for a seems-to-good-to-be-true home base. There are plenty of other things I could continue on to say in..."

His eye for detail, organized manner, and thoughtfulness comes across in so many tiny details in the cabin that will make your stay that much more comfortable. The same can be said of his communication and cabin's (Website hidden by Airbnb) was very kind of him in getting us warm pumpkin bread and papaya on the second day of our stay - which were so tasty. He also gave us helpful suggestions/information on places/hikes to visit/do and best timings for them. \n\nThe cabin itself is beautiful with its big lanai overlooking the rainforest, and big windows bringing the outside in being the highlights for us. We enjoyed sitting out and hearing the sounds of the rainforest and the wind in the pitch dark night, sleeping to the melodious pattering of the rain on the roof, and waking up to the view of the rainforest outside your bedroom windows. The cabin has a well equipped and well stocked kitchen, which was very helpful for us as we cooked our meals. The rest of the cabin was very comfortable as well.\n\nThank you Mike.  We look forward to staying here again."

He met us at the cabin when we arrived, told us about the area as well as anything we could possibly need to know about the cabin. He also had a stocked fridge with essentials, interesting books on the volcano, and about five different ways to make coffee. On top of that, he gave us great advice about hikes and how best to enjoy the volcano. \n\nThe cabin itself is truly amazing. The great pictures don't even do it justice. He clearly puts so much thought and care into every detail. \n\nThe location is perfect for seeing the volcano (an easy five minute drive to the park entrance). \n\nThis will be one of the best AirBnbs you will ever stay at. It's pretty much that simple. Thank you for one of the best stays of our honeymoon, Mike! We will be back! "

The tree ferns off the back porch beckon to the 25000 acres of tropical rainforest beyond. Bask in the light of the full moon coming through the 'front window' as you sleep in the king-sized loft bed. The host does a wonderful introduction to 'Flying Cloud' which includes the on site iPad with links to the popular attractions of the area. To the science buffs out there, prepare to be delighted. Are you a sailor perhaps? The host will regale you with tales. Two days is barely enough time to experience the area.\nI could not recommend this place more highly. A marvelous piece of tropical high-altitude 'wet coast' Hawaiian paradise awaits the visitor to 'Ao Lele Flying Cloud'. Pictures do not do it justice and pictures though worth a 1000 words barely suffice.\n"

It is so close to Volcano National Park but still feels very secluded, like you are in the middle of the rainforest (which you are!). It is even more beautiful than the pictures and I cannot recommend it highly enough. \n\nMike is the definition of above and beyond. From waiting in the driveway with an umbrella to carry our bags and protect us from the rain upon our arrival to dropping off freshly baked pumpkin bread one morning, he thinks of everything and is a very kind and considerate person. This was by far the most thorough check-in I've ever had on AirBnB, as he walked us through every detail of the cottage that we would need to know, including the many different approaches to coffee-making that were available! I'm sure he would have been happy to help if we had any questions, but he was so thorough in explanations of not only the cottage but also the national park and the Volcano community that we never had any. He obviously loves this cottage very much and you will too. \n\nMy only tip is that it does get cool in the mornings and evenings. Mike warned us about this and provided firewood, a space heater and fluffy robes so it's not a problem, but my tip is to make bring some warm lounge-wear to make the mornings and evenings even cosier, which not everybody would think about planning a trip to Hawaii.

As a result, we did not stay and found accommodations elsewhere.  The home appeared clean but the host was clearly obsessed and spent a full hour telling us the do's & don'ts, while our dinners got cold and we were shivering on the porch... Ex: don't cook steak (no ventilation), don't leave the bathroom door open (humidity issue), don't wear shoes in the house, don't bring your suitcases upstairs to the bedroom, don't be concerned that the bedroom has no curtains, don't use the lights or the space heater too much because electricity is expensive in Hawaii, don't be alarmed to see the host working in the yard during our stay, and don't be alarmed if the host comes into the house while we're gone to get his yard tools, and on and on for an hour.  The whole experience was bizarre and uncomfortable.  The host wouldn't leave until we told him we had heard enough, that it was very late, that our dinners were now cold and so were we, and our groceries were sitting on the counter unpacked.  About an hour after the host finally left, my husband attempted to bathe and fell in the tub.  He could barely get out of the tub without falling again.  In all our stays in private homes and hotels, we have never previously experienced a tub so slippery.  While we were willing to overlook the host's bizarre behavior and rules, the unsafe tub was unacceptable.    "

He went around and showed us his stunning home, a little piece of paradise, and fully equipped with anything you could need.  He supplied us with a wonderful breakfast spread (inc but not limited to coffee, eggs, papaya, cereal, oatmeal, yogurt- and all different varieties to choose from!)  He was nothing but helpful, occasionally checking in on us to see if we needed anything via the airbnb app.  We would often come back from the day to find he restocked all the food and even cleaned the sheets/towels mid-way through our stay (we stayed an entire week.)  He was helpful but also respected our privacy - we never saw him our entire stay.  \n\nThe pictures of the house do not do it justice.  It feels very secluded and yet is a minute from the main town road and a minute drive to Volcano National Park.  He has beach towels, a cooler, water bottles, head lamps for night walks, cozy blankets, plenty of pots/pans and other cooking supplies and spices you may need.  Mike also has a suggestion box in case we thought of something to make the place better, but we couldn't think of anything!\n\nAll in all, great location (short drive to Hilo, we rented jeep and traveled the whole island during our stay.), cozy and secluded house, great supplies, and a generous and helpful host.  Cannot recommend enough!"

He clearly put a lot of time and thought into making us feel comfortable and of little details we had not even considered when we booked.  His home is cosy and comfortable.  It has the feel of a little cabin in the rainforest, but has every modern convenience and then some modern technology and little details we had not thought of.  There were trail guides, books, different types of coffee makers and toasters, a bag for shopping at the farmers market, an I-pad that had an app focused on the caldera so we could see when would be a good time to view it...  every time we turned around there was time other little detail that was there fir us to appreciate. He left fresh fruit, milk, orange juice and other breakfast items to get our day started.  Wow!  We really enjoyed our time at Mike's home."

It was an extremely nice place that is meticulously cared for, and Mike gives you detailed instructions on how to maximize your stay in the cottage. You will definitely want to build in time to just hang out and relax in this amazing retreat - sitting in your robe on the sofa, in bed or on the covered porch watching the jungle and listening to the rain was extremely relaxing. Definitely just take all of the suggestions Mike gives when he checks you in, because they are all spot on. Biggest suggestion for staying in Volcano is to grocery shop in a real town before you get there, and buy ingredients for cooking because the kitchen is really well set up and once you are in for the evening you won't want to go out. He has breakfast supplies for you including oatmeal, cereal, milk, pancake mix, orange juice, and chocolate!"

We were able to not only explore volcano (the Kilauea lava lake was quite high and lava was visible) but we could time our night-viewing based on checking out the suggested USGS webcam set up on Mike's ipad. We missed viewing the first night because we hit some fog but were able to return the following night to an intensely beautiful milky way/night sky contrasted with the glorious glow of Kilauea. Although Volcano is remote, it is a great set up to check out the green and black sand beaches. Mike is so thoughtful and aware of some of the limitations of the small town, he provided a wonderful little spread so that we might enjoy home-cooked breakfast and teas. He also has an extensive coffee setup for coffee folks as well. We slept very well and there are extra touches like comfortable bedding and thick towels that show Mike's put a lot of thought into folks' stays. It does get chilly in volcano but he's got that covered too; there is rain gear, a little stove that can be lit and small space heater if the temps dip. Do bring layers if you can particularly if it's winter since elevation is >4K feet. Would've stayed longer if we could, don't miss Mike's place!"

The backyard is literally 20,000 acres of untouched forest. It is incredibly private and secluded, yet is only a 5 minute drive to get dinner/food. For a \"rustic\" style place, it is absolutely modern and very clean.\n\nMike takes care of the place so well. Everything is in perfect functioning condition and he obviously cares a lot about the place and your stay in it.\n\nLastly, Mike has an impeccable attention to detail. He even lit a fire in the wood burning stove because he knew we were coming and it was raining out. The bed and pillows were so comfortable; everything is beautifully matching (e.g. the soap dispenser, toilet flusher, and TP holder are all bronze brushed steel -- he has a knack for design); everything is premium and high quality! By the way, if you're a coffee hound like I am, he has an Aeropress for your use!\n\nWe didn't expect it, but staying at Mike's place was one of the highlights of our trip. It will be for you too, trust me!"

This absurdly clean cabin is set in a beautiful fern forest very close to the entrance to the volcano park, and although it rained during our entire stay we still had an amazing time cozying up here. Mike was super helpful, even built us a fire while we were out most days we stayed. Other good things:\n- Very comfy bed\n- Cleanest airbnb I've ever stayed in: you can tell Mike really cares for this place\n- Great kitchen amenities, if your style is to stay in and cook like ours\n- Fresh/delicious breakfast spread, which Mike restocked during our stay\n- Location: great if you're more into lush jungle vibe rather than beachy resort. Even though it was cloudy/rainy most of the time we were there in mid-February, we were so close to the park that the instant the weather cleared we were able to go see \"the glow\" of Halemaumau: the fog can descend in an instant during the winter (as it did for us) and you have to be close by to catch a good glimpse!\n\nThanks again for a wonderful cozy cabin stay."

Mike\u2019s cabin in the forested area outside the state park is a wonderfully quiet and beautiful location with all of the amenities of modern living.  Its location is perfectly situated for anyone going in to explore the park and not far off if you want to head into Hilo for some other sights and experiences.  \n \nMike is a friendly and gracious host who seems to have thought of everything. His knowledge of the surrounding area, wildlife and the volcano itself will prove invaluable to both the casual and intrepid traveller."

You wake up to the rain Forrest canopy and the birds singing. \n\nMike also provides a wide choice of excellent ingredients and food for a perfect breakfast on the veranda. \n\nI would recommend this to all friends and family visiting Hawaii\u2019s Big Island. \n\nKen"

The space is lovely - it's nestled in the woods, beautifully designed, really quiet and serene, and you wake up to the sound of birds chirping every morning.\n\nBut what really makes this place special is the amount of thought Mike has put into creating this space. It's extremely well-stocked, the lights in different parts of house are synchronized in a smart-home way, there's an iPad set up with playlist of soothing Hawaiian music and relevant info about the weather and volcanos. \n\nI so wish we could stay longer. I would highly, highly recommend it to anyone!"

My wife and I were new to Air BnB, my expectations were blown away, what a great experience with this superhost.  We even started to hesitate visiting Volcano, following the changes at Kilauea, but Mike helped us ease any concerns pre-trip.  Mike is attentive to every detail, the masterful gardening of this rainforest location, the peaceful lighting that he has fine tuned in the cabin, and the collection of music and books all set the stage for relaxation and clearing your mind of the world, focusing on what matters in life, the journey.  Don\u2019t look any further, you will be very happy here if you want to unwind and have a home base for the Big Island.  Mahalo Mike!"

There is adequate wi-fi when you need it. I travel for a living so the last thing I want on vaca is a stale hotel room. Flying cloud is a very private and cozy retreat. We picked this place out of many others that were available in the area because we wanted a nature infused seclusion. We have a 5 yr old daughter left back home with grandma and this was exactly what we needed. Easy access to Hilo , Volcano and other points of interest on the island. I proposed to my long time (15yr) side kick during a day trip to the southern most point of US. I\u2019ve been to 42 of the 50 states now and i have to say the big island is one of the most beautiful scenic places I have ever experienced. Stay here you won\u2019t be disappointed. Mike was great upon check in. Extremely thorough and engaging. After the initial orientation we never saw him again. We were left to enjoy all that the big island has to discover."

At night the stars are insanely beautiful and clear, and there are chairs and an outdoor blanket which we enjoyed in the cold. The house is on the last road before wilderness, so it really feels private and quiet. It was a treat to stay here, we hope to be back!"

You are steps to Central Park and to the 86th subway.  There are wonderful restaurants and shopping nearby if you need that but the small kitchen is fine for quick snacks and breakfast.  It was especially nice to sit on the little patio to eat my toast and tea and even with the NYC humming around you it is lovely to have an outdoor space.  Chas answered all my many questions with great patience and care...he really wanted us to have a wonderful time and went beyond the call of duty by even sending us links to good places to watch big soccer matches.  The apartment was clean when we arrived and had the basic things we needed such as towels and extra sheets.  While not the cheapest option on BNB it gave us all a wonderful bed to sleep in, space to spread out in when needed, and a fantastic location!  We even found street parking for the full 5 days!  Picking up the keys was a breeze and we left a few basic things for the next guests to enjoy from the corner store.   It is a gorgeous street to stay on and felt very safe. Thank you so much Chas!  We hope to return one day soon."

The location is perfect particularly for those wanting access to Central Park and the museum mile (Guggenheim etc) but it was also a revelation to explore that end of Broadway.  The apartment is lovely and has everything.  We especially appreciated the study nook and ability to use our laptop with wifi access and the well equipped kitchen for easy prep for meals (and deli close by makes it so easy to stock up).  The lounge, bedroom and bathroom are all in good, comfortable condition.  The little balconies and view of the courtyard topped it off.  A great experience and thoroughly recommend."

There are so many details -- from the art on the walls to the spices in the kitchen -- that make it feel like a home away from home. The apartment is small but imminently comfortable with high ceilings and patios that make it feel spacious. The unit is off the street (on a courtyard)  so it was very quiet (that  and the comfortable bed made for great nights of sleeping). It's a beautiful street, just off Central Park and just around the corner from the subway. There are abundant restaurants within a 5 minute walk and the best coffee in NY (Joe's) is only about two blocks away. Chas was a great host who was quick to answer all our questions and make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We had our two sons with us (ages 10 and 12) and the living arrangements were ideal for a family our size. Thanks, Chas!"

It's not a huge apartment but the lofted ceilings give it a nice, open feel. Central Park, the subway, a convenience store, a wine store, and Starbucks are all within a block or two. When I first booked the reservation I was unsure about the process to get the keys, but it turns out I had no reason to be worried whatsoever. It was very easy and worked out well.

Both Chas and Paul were quick at answering emails and provided us with plenty of information re local grocery shops etc. The pick-up of the keys was also very simple. \r\nThe apartment is in a great location, half a block from Central Park and close to several subway lines. Only up one flight of stairs, which was good because there are no lifts! \r\nThe apartment was very well equipped with everything you need for a stay away from home - bedding, towels, full kitchen etc. It was a bit smaller than it appears in the photos and could do with a lick of paint, but was very clean and had plenty of storage. Also, keep in mind that the beds in the loft may provide a bit of a problem for some guests - definitely best for kids. \r\nOverall, we had a great time at Chas' apartment and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to visit New York!

The images of the apartment are accurate and the Upper West Side area was great - close to Central Park, a heap of stores and restaurants, away from the noise. The first floor does have a low ceiling which is ideal for smaller children. The apartment was always warm so it was a treat to come back home after a long day out in the cold. Would definitely consider staying here again."

The heating is excellent and the building is very quiet with almost no ambient noise whatsoever; again, a rarity in New York. The apartment is located in a beautiful street lined with old Brownstones, so would be perfect for those who prefer a genteel New York neighbourhood rather than an urban, grungy one. It is located a few minutes' walk from the subway and a block back from Central Park. Great spot, and the owners were easy to arrange accommodation with."

I couldn't hear any street noise and slept well. \r\nThere's a hairdryer which made my day as well :D\r\nPaul was very responsive to questions I had, and went out of his way to make sure check in was easy. \r\nHighly recommended.

If you walk to Columbus Avenue, there are stores and restaurants and also on Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway. Its a great place to stay if you want to enjoy NYC and then come back to a quiet and tranquil retreat. Our host was very communicate regarding the arrangements for acquiring the apartment keys and any questions we had were answered promptly. There is a laundry in the basement of the building which makes it easy to wash and dry your clothes. The Museum of Natural History is close by and so is the NY Historical Society and of course beautiful Central Park and one can walk towards the  Henry Hudson River to Riverside Park.  Overall a lovely and positive experience. Thank you!"

It is beautifully located right next to Central Park, as well as roads like Columbus, which has ample coffee shops, bars and restaurants. It is also very close to the subway station for easy exploring of other districts like Greenwich Village and Brooklyn. We were able to walk to lower Manhattan (Times Sq, Rockerfella Centre etc). The flat was the perfect cosy place to come back to and watch the snow. We felt very safe and everyone we met in the area was incredibly friendly, particularly Paul and Chas' friend Gail who assisted us with keys and NYC recommendations! We would happily recommend this apartment to any future visitors - we are very sad to leave!"

Very happy to be so close to the subway which made going downtown very easy. \n\nWe were a couple and extra adult, who slept in the loft. It is a loft (can't stand up) but nice to sleep on a real mattress,  as opposed to fold out sofas like much of the value for money accommodation in New York. \n\nChas was easy to communicate with, and very accommodating as we were able to arrange for us to drop our bags off early before check in so that we could head off and explore. Would stay again in the future, as such great value for money (and doesn't feel like your staying a shoe box, like most of NYC). Would be perfect for families. Thanks! "

UWS and UES is about the same, but this location at UWS is quieter. \n\nFor great restaurants just walk on over to Columbus Av, Amsterdam Av or Broadway and your set. \n\nThe apartment: It was nice, big and homely. The bushes by the little veranda could use some trimming but we didn't have time to use it anyway. \nAC is really good. You leave it off when you go out. Put it on when you get back in and it's nice, and cool in minutes. \nAs indicated, the ceiling in the loft is low. You can't stand up straight. But there's plenty of room up there. \n\nCommunicating with Chas was easy. He always answered my questions quickly. \n\nOverall a great experience! "

The location could not be beat - close to everything in Williamsburg including the waterfront and both the JMZ and L Trains for easy access to Manhattan.  Her unit is decent sized and quiet.  The bed was very comfortable and the furniture and decorations nice.  It was also very clean.  While I never met her, check in and communication were a breeze.  We would not hesitate to stay at her place again."

Besides, it's so well-located in the heart of Williamsburg surrounded with a lot of restaurants and bars and close to Manhattan(1 stop - Metro L Bedford 5-minute walking). If you want to discover Brooklyn, it's the perfect place. Ade will give you the name of all the places she likes around her flat. We had the chance to meet Ade our last day and she'is as her flat : really nice and charming :) She let us leave our luggages very late as our plane was at midnight whereas she has already came back from her trip and was jetlag! Thanks a lot Ade for everything! Do not hesitate to rent her flat"

The bed was comfortable and the decor made you feel instantly at home.  Wifi was excellent and a decent sized TV with Netflix which we didn't use once because there were more exciting things to do.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the apartment block is very quiet ... amazing given how close it is to the main road of restaurants, shops and bars of Bedford Avenue.  \r\n\r\nWe walked around day and night in perfectly safe environment.  We took Ade up on some recommended places to eat and they were all great local places, well researched.\r\n\r\nIt was easy walking distance to all points of interest in Williamsburg, from the vintage market to the regular street food festival and East River Ferry, providing access to other parts of Brooklyn, downtown NYC and Governor's Island.  \r\n\r\nThe short walk to different subways meant getting into the city was very fast, particularly areas such as East Village and Park Slope.  We regularly went from the heart of the city back to the apartment within 20-30 minutes, a good escape when the crowds got too much in  Manhattan.\r\n\r\nAde welcomed in and helped us up with the bags on day 1.  There is no lift but compared to subways, a few flights of stairs was not a problem.  Again, on departure day she was very accommodating letting us leave the bags and helping us with getting them down again."

The apartment is in a perfect location and although it is in the center of everything, it is still very quiet day and night.\r\nAde was very nice from the first conversation until the end of our visit and made us feel very comfortable about staying at her apartment. We felt that she really wanted that everything will be perfect for us. She even let us leave our luggage at the apartment after checking out.\r\nThe apartment is spacious with lots of windows full of natural light and air.

It has a clean, nice shower, a comfortable bed, a roomy sitting area and a writing desk. It also has a small, very practical kitchen that you can use to cook meals when not eating out. There's a medium size flat screen TV in the bedroom, with Netflix, and the internet wifi connection, which is immensely important to me as a tech guy on the go, was lightning fast.\r\n\r\nThe building is a little old and unkept, but don't let that scare you - the apartment is in perfect condition. Do be aware that it's on the 4th floor and the stairwell is quite steep, so don't stay here if you have a disability or very small children.\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful thing about the apartment is the neighbourhood. Williamsburg is charming, and there are numerous cafes, bars and restaurants literally a few steps away. I particularly liked \"Samurai Mama\" and \"Snacky\", check them out if you're into Asian food. There's also the Williamsburg Music Hall and the Knitting Factory - well known venues where you can sample the local rock bands. And, importantly, the streets felt to me safe enough to walk around alone at night.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is a few minutes away from the subway station where you can take the L train to Manhattan - a few stations away.\r\n\r\nAde herself was friendly and very helpful. I found her to be the perfect host - responsive enough when I needed her, but she didn't bother me at all when I didn't.\r\n\r\nI travel to NYC a lot, and I will be more than happy to stay at Ade's again next time I get there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

She also recommended some local places to check out and pointed out all the nearby amenities. She couldn't have been any more helpful and she is a really friendly and genuine person.\n\nHer apartment feels really homely and has great character. It's a great reflection of her style and personality. I felt very comfortable staying there.\n\nHer apartment is right on the doorstep of all the action in and around Bedford Ave and really close to the subway too. You couldn't ask for a better location in Williamsburg. If you happen to be from Melbourne you will find Williamsburg is quite like Fitzroy with a similar vibe to Smith/Brunswick Streets.\n\nI have nothing negative at all to say about my whole experience. It truly was perfect in every way. I can't recommend Adela and her apartment highly enough.\n\nTo Adela... thanks for everything. I appreciate it very much! :)"

We're sorry we didn't have a chance to meet her, but very thankful for her hospitality. Adela's apartment is spotless and comfortable, and it provided a great home base during our adventure in snowy New York. It's also very conveniently located near the Williamsburg Bridge."

It's a New York one bedroom, so it's not big, but Ade has done a great job with the space in terms of functionality and aesthetics, and the windows let in a ton of light during the day, so you don't feel cramped.  We stayed during a mid-summer heat wave, so the air-conditioner was key, and even though it doesn't do a great job of cooling down the bedroom, we slept pretty comfortably.  One minor thing to note:  there's no real closet space or drawers to put your belongings.  We're not the type that mind living out of our suitcases, so it didn't necessarily bother us, but I thought it was worth mentioning. \r\n\r\nAde was very quick with her communication, so getting into and checking out of her apartment proved simple and convenient \r\n\r\nI would say this is the perfect place to stay if you want a cute, centrally located Brooklyn home base with easy access to Manhattan and you don't plan on hanging out very much at the apartment... but it's New York, so what the heck are you doing hanging out in an apartment anyway?!?!\r\n"

You find all you need just around the corner, it\u2019s a few blocks from the waterfront, Brooklyn bridge/Dumbo and also to the metro, if you are interested visiting Manhattan it\u2019s just a few minutes with the train. Although it's in a crowded area, it\u2018s quiet. I totally recommend this apartment , very clean and filled with nice art pieces. Ade was the perfect host, always helpful and she never let me wait at any time. I was very happy being your guest. Thank you Ade!"

        "comments": "Good location at a good price.  The apartment is less than a half a block off of Bedford at a location that has a lot of good local bars and restaurants.  We felt very safe though there is a vacant lot that you could walk by on her street.  However, we did not make much of it, but you could walk on the other side of the street if that bothers you.  The street is well lit.  We worried a little about noise given Williamsburg's reputation for hipness.  However, this ended up not being a problem.  Restaurants were still open after 9, but you could still walk into them without reservations.  At night, it was busy enough to feel safe, but it was sparse enough for it to be farely quiet.\n\nGetting into Manhattan can be an issue.  The L train is the only train coming into the neighborhood.  If it isn't running, the closest stop is Marcy at the end of the Williamsburg bridge which is probably a 30 minute walk.  The ferry, which is a bargain, is close and will cross the East River and drop you off at 34th close to the UN Building.  However, it does not run after 9:30 in the evening.\n\nAde's building is a little ratty which you will see in the stairwell.  However, her apartment is perfectly fine.  The bed is comfortable which is nice compared to most Air BNB hosts.  There is a window unit AC for the entire apartment.  Depending on the time of year, I am not sure if it will cool the bedroom well since it's in a different part of the apartment (though there is an oscillating fan there).  We did not have a problem since it was October.  There is no microwave oven.  It is four flights up with pretty large stairs and no elevator.  I would avoid this apartment if you are elderly or handicapped.\n\nWe did not meet Ade which it is getting pretty common not to meet the host.  However, we had no problems.  The process to get the key was easy.  She had recommendations printed and posted in the room, and she was quick to respond to questions by messaging.\n\nFor our purposes, this was a great place to consider if the L train is running.  We would not stay her again if the L train isn't running.  However, if you don't mind working around the ferry schedule and you want to visit Williamsburg and Greenpoint, this will work well for you."

The entire island is out of this world beautiful, but this property's secluded location and private beach make the ocean views that much more special and breathtaking. I booked the home as accommodation for my wedding party guests (my husband and I had a small, beach wedding in the North Shore) and it was perfect. We had everything we needed and the extra beds in each room saved me headache and money - very efficient! Noah was also quite accommodating when I told him our original plan of having the ceremony on the private beach and outside reception in the backyard (which we didn't wind up doing) - he was totally cool with it. Overall, a wonderful Hawaii experience in a lovely beach home where I felt at home and completely relaxed. "

The ocean access and view was phenomenal. It was everything we could have asked for.  The house was stocked very well with all the necessities.  I would definitely stay here again no matter what I planned to do on Oahu.  It was very easy to get south or north from here. I would definitely recommend this home to everyone."

The property is very family friendly although the beach was less sand than the photos (probably due to the fall/winter season). The beach dand house are very private. The four bathrooms with showers were very useful after swims and hikes with so many needing to shower. Hot water is plentiful."

We woke up to the sound of the ocean every morning and beautiful views. We had all the amenities we needed and Noah was able to answer any additional queries we had throughout the stay. Being winter we missed out on beach access as the tide was in, but it didn't stop us taking advantage of the private water access and sitting out on the steps. There were food trucks and cafes and restaurants nearby, as well as grocery stores within a short driving distance. The rustic feel of Laie is so much more pleasant than the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. "

Perfect for returning from the beach.\n\nNegatives:\n-Floors were not clean, feet got super dirty even indoors.\n-Lots of flies in the kitchen.  Not sure if we just got unlucky of if this is constant.\n-No sand on the beach.  Water access involves some slippery stones."

        "comments": "This beach house is an absolute gem and some of the photos just don't do it justice. From the moment you walk into the front door, you have stunning views of the ocean. We enjoyed breathtaking sunrises from the master bedroom and outdoor sunbathing pad almost every day. We chose this location for our intimate wedding ceremony and casual dinner for about 45 friends and family. We originally planned both the ceremony and dinner outdoors, but due to the unusually windy weather, we decided to host the dinner in the spacious living room instead, which worked out great. Noah was very responsive and helpful before we arrived in Hawaii, as well as throughout the wedding weekend. Unlike previous reviewers, we had no issues with the hot water, the floors were clean when we arrived, and flies only became an issue when we left the doors open for long periods of time. There wasn't any sand on the beach in early March, but the water was calm and protected - perfect for wading around with water shoes. The house was fully stocked with amenities, and in a fantastic location if you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and Honolulu. I would highly recommend staying at Noah's beach house, and hope to find another reason to stay again in the future. Thank you Noah for making our weekend so memorable."

The water right in front of the house is the perfect spot for snorkeling and we saw lots of fish and a seal that came right by us a few times! When the tide is out the water is very calm. Around the corner is Pounders beach which has some decent waves for boogie boarding. It is a 5 minute walk to the Polynesian Cultural Center and about an hour from Honolulu. If you want a more slow paced vacation away from crowds then this is the perfect spot. We would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat. Our whole group loved it."

The hot water was able to keep up with three showers going at the same time and the kitchen was plenty big enough for all.  The host was extremely easy to work with and had pre-stocked the house with pots/pans, paper towels, coffee, toilet paper, etc.\n\nThe best part about this house was the location, being right on the coast.  There is a nice back patio, and another concrete slab by the water with steps leading down to the beach.  The master bedroom has windows facing the ocean, so you can open the windows and hear the surf all night and wake up to the sunrise.\n\nI would most definitely rent this house again, and certainly from this renter."

With 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms we all felt like we had enough personal space and the large kitchen and living area was such an added bonus for so many bodies! The house has an enormous side/backyard with steps that lead to the perfect little private beach. We honestly had a hard time ever wanting to leave the house! The house came equipped with kayaks, canoes, boogie boards, and plenty of toys to keep us entertained! Noah and his family were beyond hospitable. They went out of their way to make sure everything was going smoothly and truly made us feel so welcome! We hope we get to come back soon!!!"

The yard, the lanai, the living room & kitchen all have ample space for everyone to spread out. The beach location is amazing and private; the reef & tides making it fun & safe for all ages.  Noah provides everything you could possibly need to make it the perfect Hawaiian vacation.  Four bathrooms & five showers make it the perfect spot for a girls getaway as well. We will certainly be planning additional adventures here in the future- highly recommended!"

Not recommended for copuples seeking a romantic trip since is quite busy and noisy. Big dissapointed was that Water heater didnt work and had to take a cold water shower. Regarding owner response, it took a while for him/her to answer but afterwards everything was fine."

Although we usually stay in a hotel on Hong Kong Island, we decided to stay in Jenkin's place due to the price, apparent cleanliness, and in order to better experience life in Kowloon.  We were definitely not disappointed.  The unit is quite small but they make efficient use of the space and the reality is that it was more spacious than any hotel room, aside from the most deluxe suites. Location wise it doesn't get any better.  Just steps from Tsim Sha Tsui (TST), and then everything that TST has to offer readily at hand.  Shopping and eating for all price ranges and tastes.  We won't hesitate to stay there again on future visits to the city."

To extend it to become a bed and making sure that it is fixed correctly, must be extra careful as  my son hurt his hand. \nLiving room aircon - thought aircon was spoilt as we couldnt on it. We didnt know that the switch, which is hidden in the cupboard, is not switch on until when we met Helen when we are checking out.\nOverall, we still can accept and hope that there will be improvement. Thanks to both Jenkin and Helen."

He also allowed me to keep those luggages while I kill some times before leaving. Thank you for that! Room was very nice, clean, cozy (looks exactly from the pictures). Amenities are there, TV, kitchen, iron, etc. Wifi is good! Location is perfect! Going to places were easy via MTR. The area around the apartment was always busy but very safe, I must say. Happy with the whole trip to HK. Stay with Jenkin, highly recommended! Thank you for everything, Jenkin and Ricky! And thank you to Helen too! "

        "comments": "Location is almost everything in Hong Kong.  Host service is a close second. Jenkin is an accessible and attentive host, and that's something you may need in a complicated city like Hong Kong. This is an efficiently designed very small space which makes it seem larger than it is. The layout is (1) a bed-sized sleeping area with a curtain and sliding door for privacy; (2) a comfortably sized and appointed bathroom with a nicely tiled shower with plenty of hot water and strong water pressure; and (3) a living room with comfortable sofa, reliable wifi, and clothes hanging rack. There is a fridge and microwave and hotplate, with enough cookware for two people. You wash your dishes in the bathroom.  All three rooms are recently remodeled and tiled.  The bed is very comfortable. Both the bedroom and living room have air conditioners.\r\n\r\nThe little apartment is on the 6th floor of an old and dingy (but clean) Kowloon apartment building one block from the stunning fountains of Kowloon Park and the subway, and a million places right there in your face.  It is a 10 minute exciting walk (as in every single time its exciting) to the picturesque  harbor ferry to Hong Kong Island (or you can take the subway there).  Like many Asian buildings, the elevators are very slow and often crowded with friendly people, but remarkably, each floor has an elevator on either end of the hallway. You walk out of Jenkin's apartment, look left and look right to see which elevator will arrive first, a fun little game for us. \r\n\r\nThe very safe neighborhood is extremely trendy, filled with excited locals and tourists, and many places open until late. (My favorite bar and restaurant were open until 3am, both very funky). \r\n\r\nI might stay in one of Jenkin's larger units next time but, you know, I'm not sure since this little place just grows on you after two days.  He is a master host, his cleaning lady is so nice and right nearby, and he takes a lot of pride in making your stay high quality.  He even guided our taxi driver to the front door by cell phone, and he is always, always accessible.  It's remarkable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "comments": "The apartment is in a great location for exploring the Tsim Sha Sui area. The MTR station is right outside the building entrance, and the harbor area is just a few blocks away to the south and west. The living space is small but well organized, with a separate bedroom (just big enough for the bed) with its own air-con, and the bathroom is a very usable size. The main drawback to the apartment is that it is on the 6th floor of a 15 floor building and the queues can get long for the elevator. There is one elevator at each end of the long hall on the 6th floor but on the ground level they are completely separated.  A few times I waited on the ground floor in a queue for 15-20 minutes and the elevator fills up before being able to get in, so plan your trips, don't expect to go in and out a lot, and avoid mid-day and evening hours when people are coming home.  Of course this is not an issue the host can resolve, but I think any guests should anticipate."

Not only that but the place is literally beside the MTR Tsim Sha Tsui Station, so commuting is a breeze. \r\n\r\nYou'll never feel alone given how responsive and accommodating Jenkin is. Helen (the housekeeping lady) beats any housekeeping services from hotels. She's easy to talk to and extremely friendly. \r\n\r\nI'm definitely going back. "

I had a great stay and I def. recommend the place. The dumpling place on the first floor of the building was a nice surprise too, should check it out if you choose to stay here. "

The apartment is nice in the inside and located near a MTR location which is great.  if you stay here make sure to eat at possianos pizza place which is about a five minute walk. Best pizza ever. Lastly, for the price of hotels in Hong Kong I'm sure James could raise the price and still rent this out. Hotels are outrageous in HK. Don't hesitate to book this place. "

V\u00e1rias op\u00e7\u00f5es de comida ao redor, supermercados, shopping centers, lavanderias etc. Ponto negativo para o colch\u00e3o pouco confort\u00e1vel e para o barulho de campainha do 7eleven em frente que passa a noite inteira tocando. Anfitri\u00e3o atencioso. Voltaria a me hospedar."

It was literally at the corner of the TST station which was convenient to go to ANYwhere, not to mention all those places and attractions you must visit right around the area. The room was very clean and spacious to comfortably fit both of us. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wish to stay around the TST area. "

Walking distance to the Star Ferry.\nI wouldn't recommend more than 2 people staying at this apartment, as it is small, but more than suitable for a couple. It had everything you could need.\nThe lift wasn't working one night when we got back late but received excellent communication from the host immediately with what to do.\nThanks for the stay!"

The place is very clean and with complete home stuffs like microwave, ref, tissues, towels, etc. feels like your at your home. Don't expect that the place is big, but if you're staying for travel only the place is perfect for you, and compare with the HK standard the apartment was big unlike the other hostels in HK which has only 10-11sqm. 4persons can fit the room If we'd visit HK again, i would definitely stay here again. And I would highly recommend this place to my friends. Thank you for the nice service."

We stayed 4 people and 1 child, so it was little crowded for us. We did not spend lots of time in room anyway, so it was perfectly fine. James was very great host. He responded promptly and visited to take care to make sure we had enough beds. He also allowed us to leave luggages after check out. Love the place!"

Okay for a short stay, but I would opt to be somewhere quieter for a longer stay. "

The building is older, but it does have an elevator. \nThe apartment is really just a room that is divided into a tiny sleeping area with a sliding glass panel and curtain. There is no kitchen just a fridge, hot water kettle and some dishes, cups, etc. There is no place to even wash cups or dishes other than the bathroom. The apartment is nicely renovated and decorated and the bed and couch are comfortable. The shower pressure is good. It is in a busy shopping and restaurant area but it was quiet enough at night for us to sleep with earplugs. \nWe had a problem at check in. We needed an early check in and I asked for this before booking. Phoebe, the co-host assured me several times that we could arrive early and I reconfirmed the time after I booked it. Unfortunately, Phoebe did not tell her assistant and we arrived to find ourselves locked out. We messaged James and the only response we got was to contact Phoebe. Phoebe couldn\u2019t be reached- later when we spoke she explained that she had lost her phone for a period of time. She was very apologetic and brought us a bottle of wine. No corkscrew in the apartment but still nice of her. The next day we were able to store our luggage for a couple of hours without a problem. \n\nThis place is nice but understand that it is basically a hotel room. I don\u2019t know the prices of hotels in that area but I suspect they\u2019re much higher. It\u2019s a clean, comfortable room in a great location."

The only pain would be the size of the condo\u2014it\u2019s ideal for two. But we came with two little kids, so it turned out to be quite an embarrassment for us... The landlord has been very responsive. We have to give him credit for that. \nAirbnb customer service was overwhelmingly great! They were very responsible and responsive, and they were quick to take care of our requests and inquiries. Overall speaking, this property is an ideal place for singles or young couples WITHOUT having children with them..."

All amenities and features work well--air con, wifi, water, security, ventilation.  It's compact, but big enough for one or two people: comfy bed with black-out curtains in the bedroom,  sofa in the living room, bathroom big enough for two. It's clean and feels homey.  The location is unbeatable, steps from MTR exit, park, mosque, shops, all that TST and HK have to offer.  There's an excellent fried-bao shop on the ground floor!  Finally, the check-in/out was super-easy, and communication with the manager was always rapid and obliging.  Highly recommended."

What to eat will seem like the difficult choice because of the variety. \n\nThe apartment itself is on a sixth floor with an elevator. Clean and cozy. Once I stepped in I felt right at home. A comfortable space for 2 people. \n\nHong Kong itself marveled. There\u2019s so much to do and see even if it\u2019s not your first time. Having James\u2019 home away from home location allowed for maximum enjoyment. \n\nWill stay here again on my next visit. \n\nThank you!"

We never used public transport, apart from getting there and leaving Porto. \r\nThere was some noise in the mornings as an adjacent apartment was undergoing renovation, but I guess that's permanent.\r\nOther than that this place is good value for money.

We had a great Time in the flat which was perfect, big, with everything necessary to clean And make food. The flat was close to city centre and to marques metro station. In the are there were shops and bars to have breakfast and buy food. We have been welcomed by cristina's friend Silvia which was very kind and patient Even if We called her few Times because We couln't find the apartment! Thank You very much "

She was also very responsive to any questions and let us check-in early.  The flat was great, spacious with plenty of room for all five of us, and we really enjoyed being able to hang out in the living room with a glass of port on our last night! Also, being just around the corner from a metro stop, it made getting into the city center very quick. The only downside was that even with the small space heaters in each room, the flat did get very cold. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend staying at Cristina's flat!"

Cos\u00ec ho cominciato a cercare tra gli host un appartamento nella citt\u00e0 di Porto che avesse le caratteristiche necessarie per questo viaggio vacanza per ospitare le 6 persone comodamente. \nOvviamente cercavo anche qualcosa di economico.\nAlla fine ho contattato Cristina in quanto la sua offerta era molto vantaggiosa sia economicamente sia per la capacit\u00e0 di spazio di cui avevo bisogno. \nL'appartamento si trova molto poco distante  dal centro della citt\u00e0 solo due fermate da Trinidate (centro nevralgico di tutte le metropolitane di Porto e per andare sia verso l'aeroporto che verso le stazioni ferroviarie), ma a pochi passi dalla fermata della metropolitana di Marques. \nL'appartamento si trova al quarto piano di un palazzo servito con ascensore.\nCon l'host ci siamo dati appuntamento alle 13.30 presso l'appartamento. \nQuindi mi ha fatto vedere l'appartamento e mi ha spiegato come funzionavano le cose della casa, il collegamento al wi fi e dove riporre le chiavi quando avrei dovuto lasciare l'abitazione, e se avevo bisogno di ulteriori informazioni. \nQuindi ci siamo salutati. \nL'appartamento corrispondeva a ci\u00f2 che avevo visto su Airbnb. Pulito, ordinato e tutto funzionante. Ci siamo trovati molto bene, come a casa.\nLo consiglio a chiunque. \n"

The location was a short walk from the metro and an easy taxi journey to the centre of town, so very well connected. The apartment had everything we needed for cooking, cleaning and relaxing and has restaurants, shops and so on near by. Porto is a beautiful city, with so much to do and Christina's apartment is a fantastic place to stay to experience it. "

Great kitchen, comfortable living room, and just a really cozy and nice apartment to come home to each day after exploring.  Two bathrooms - a rarity in Europe - and a lift in the building for hauling your bags up the stairs.  A little bit out of the tourist center, which in our view provided a more authentic experience.  Great place!"

Het ligt iets verder weg van het centrum maar door het metrostation vlakbij toch heel gemakkelijk bereikbaar. De kamers waren heel erg schoon, net als de badkamers, en ook de keuken was voldoende voorzien. En vooral Anabela, de dame die je ontvangt, is gewoonweg fantastisch. Ze heeft ons van heel veel leuke tips voorzien, ook dingen om te doen met onze kinderen, en ze was altijd bereikbaar voor vragen ed. Dit appartement is zeker een aanrader!"

The apartment is rather equipped like a hotel suit but Osman is very helpful and he will surely try to accommodate if you have additional requests (he bought a new iron as I have needed one). I think this apartment is a perfect alternative to a hotel in order to get a excellent location and good decoration for a reasonable price."

There is also supermarket just around the corner. So very convenient! We had everything we needed in the apartment, but don't expect 5star hotel :) It is cosy home atmosphere. There are some problem in shower as water is passing by and getting on floor, but otherwise all is good :) Thank's for Osman and his team! Osman was very responsive, when I had some doubts due to not calm situation in Taksim square. Luckily all was good :) I can for sure recommend Osman and his apartments as home out of home :) "

Our host and landlord Osman cannot be faulted. He was there for any of out needs and questions and was continuously welcoming and friendly during out stay. I will be returning in the future and could not imagine a better place to stay. The area of the apartment was perfect. A stone throw away from the main street and taxsim square and a 5 minute walk to kabatas. I couldn't think of a better place to stay if your a family or a young group like we were. I cannot recommend this more. THANK YOU OSMAN"

Apartments are clean and well furnished.  \r\nOsman took great care of us.  Because the person before us had not checked out from our room when we arrived, Osman placed us in a different room, then moved us to a top floor penthouse for our second night. The view from the roof top suite the second night was fantastic. Osman was very responsive and easy to work with.  I highly recommend staying in his apartments when in Istanbul. "

Sleeping was comfortable for each of us, Osman provided us after request with extra blanket so that we didnt have to sleep under one for couples. The apartment provided also free Wifi which was working great and there was also hair dryer which we apreciated a lot. We would definitely recommend this appartment to our friends. "

Taxim is real center, and you can easily walk to some other great parts of Istanbul  from there (Dolmabahce palace, Istanbul Moderna, Istiklal street...) or take cab that is really cheap. Plus, as I said appartment is cozy and clean, and Osman is like the good host, there for most of the times (which is not always the case). Recomendation for sure!\r\n"

There is although a small kitchen with cooking stuff with help you to reduce your eating costs so much. the place of the residence is also very good.Just about 3 to 4 minutes far from Taksim square. When we got the apartment in the early morning, actually 3 hours before the check-in time, Osman was so kind to give us another apartment until our apartment gets ready. In the same way, because we were about to leave Istanbul some hours after the check out time, Osman helped us to leave our staff in his office and enjoy our last hours in the city. and the photos are exactly the same as the apartment. I highly recommend the apartment."

We were 4 and we felt very comfortable sleeping in a large bed in a separate room and 2 comfortable sofa-beds for 1 person each (could also be 2 and 1).  Although the kitchen is a bit small we managed to cook most of the meals there (there is a Carrefour grocery store 30m away).  There is also a lot of very good restaurants nearby.\r\n\r\nThe flat is very safe as Osman or one of his friends is always on site to control who enters the building.\r\n\r\nThe flat is about 30 minutes from the airport (Ataturk) by taxi.\r\n\r\nThank you Osman for a perfect stay in the wonderful Istanbul!"

Osman provided clear instructions to get there and was waiting for us upon our arrival. The other people who man the desk in this building don't really speak English, but they could always call Osman for help which they did. He was helpful with other questions we had too. There was a problem with the plumbing in the bathroom, some leaking around the base of the toilet - which made the small bathroom quite wet. Osman offered to have it fixed while we were there to be fair, but we didn't want a tradesman through during our stay. It will hopefully be repaired when you stay here. The electric stove top did not seem to work, but all other appliances did. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay."

Each apartment has its own key which only allows you to access that floor......but somehow there was a problem with the key of another apartment and they came to our floor by mistake and arrived in our apartment! Quite a shock to find them in our kitchen, but luckily they were just friendly and confused tourists. The whole building seems to be just 4-5 apartments rented only to tourists.

Es gibt unz\u00e4hlige nette Bars und Restaurants in der N\u00e4he, man kann von dort aus gut zu Fuss los oder die Metro nutzen. Obwohl wir abends erst sehr sp\u00e4t ankamen hatte man uns ein Taxi organisiert, welches uns direkt zur Wohnung brachte. Auch als wir so sp\u00e4t noch auf die Suche nach den n\u00e4chsten Kneipen gingen bekamen wir Hilfe.\r\nInsgesamt war es \u00fcberhaupt kein Problem nach irgendetwas zu fragen, Osman war immer hilfsbereit und freundlich!\r\nAuch mit der Wohnungsausstattung waren wir zufrieden. Die Wohnung ist nicht besonders gross, war aber auch f\u00fcr 4 Leute absolut ausreichend und an Sauberkeit fehlte es auch nicht."

If you like an authentic atmosphere, good bars, restaurants, antique shops, ... it's the place to be! Nighttime can be quite noisy because of cheering football fans or people drinking in the streets in weekends. Walking distance to Taksim square, where you have all public transport. If you are in good shape, it's nice to explore the neighborhood by foot."

The bathroom is tight but it is expected when you live in downtown. The appartment is very clean.\n\nNegative:\nSaturday evening the noise coming from nightclubs around the place was annoying till 3am. If you sleep early in weekends, this is not your perfect spot."

        "comments": "I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Bobby's bungalow, so much so that I extended my stay an additional week!  The cottage is very comfortable and equipped with everything you need.   The space is open and roomy, even more so than the listing pics suggest.   As with many Hawaiian dwellings, there are lots of windows, and the cottage offers an open air, indoor/outdoor style of living.   \r\n\r\nAlso of note: the bed is new and king-sized, and is super comfortable-- one of the best I've slept on lately.  Its wonderfully supportive and guarantees a great night's sleep.  Internet access and speeds were very good, something of a priority for me.   Washer and drier out the back door was also a plus.   Out the front door is a picnic table  (put to good use everyday),  and a shady sitting area under a blooming Hong Kong Orchid tree-- delightful.\r\n\r\nThe cottage basically sits on its own parcel, with your own private driveway, and so it offers good privacy.   The location is somewhat off the beaten path, which I found desirable, as areas of the North Shore can get busy at times.  Still, there's easy access to area beaches, shopping in Haleiwa, the weekend farmer's market's, etc.   And then there's literally miles of amazing beaches to explore from the cottage to Ka'ena Point.   \r\n\r\nSaving the best for last: Bobby and Mike are excellent hosts and genuinely lovely people-- the aloha spirit here is awesome.  Both are very friendly and  accommodating,  generously sharing weekend BBQ dishes (delicious!) and providing a fresh pineapple to welcome their guest.   I had a great time at the Banyan Bungalow-- only wish I could have stayed longer.  Highly recommended!"

I think the thing that struck us most (as city dwellers) were sounds, dozing off at night to all sorts of lovely birds and the ocean. The cottage itself us cute clean and very well maintained.

The neighboring roosters are up at around 5am, but almost every residential area in Hawaii has those...also a good reason to get out of bed and watch the sun rise! I would definitely stay here again."

There are roosters fairly close that were a bit loud in the mornings, but we simply closed two windows and it was fine.  There also seem to be roosters everywhere on the North Shore anyway.

Bobby was quick to respond to my last minute inquiry (next day booking), and they had a nice welcome pack for me. I also loved that the kitchen was well stocked with a blender and juicer. I booked this over another place because of a review that the king size bed is comfortable - and it definitely was! There's a beach close by, and I was often the only one on it (or only with a few others), which is incredible to find for the busy island. I'd come back for sure. \r\n\r\nThe area is great, Haleiwa is close by (10min drive) with lots of great restaurants (including a couple great organic, locally sourced ones), smoothie bars, grocery store and surf lessons."

Delicious!\r\n\r\nThe place is 10 min walk to a beautiful beach where you have high chances to be all by yourself and experience an amazing sunset.\r\n\r\nIt is a 15 min drive to Haleiwa, the nearest city center with restaurants and groceries. \r\n\r\nAlthough the place is very quite and most of the time you can only hear the sound of leafs and sea breeze, the other propertirs have a lot of birds, so you may hear some birds singing early in the morning.\r\n\r\nI would definetly comeback!"

She showed us around and then gave us privacy. \r\n\r\nThe property itself was more than the pictures show. A lot of space on the property and even a second separate outdoor shower to help wash off the sand from the beach which is less than 5 minutes walk away. \r\n\r\nThis is a perfect location. Close to Haleiwa and the North Shore. If you want some peace and quiet and would like to have a wonderful view of the starry night, you'll find it here. This residence gave us the experience of living in the real Authentic country Hawaii that we were looking for.\r\n\r\nWhen a tropical storm rolled in a few days before we left, she left a flashlight and a few supplies for us in case we needed them. Bobby takes care of this place well and it shows.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for letting us stay in your beautiful home, and to anyone considering this location, away from the city, go for it. You'll be glad you did."

The cottage was exactly as in the pictures and Bobby had left some local treats including freshly laid eggs from her own hens for me! The area is so safe you don't need to shut the doors and it is quiet as anything-except for the wild roosters, but these are everywhere in Hawaii and you get used to them very quickly.  The beach is a short walk away, and Bobby loaned me a beach cruiser bicycle so I could ride into the North Shore town of Haleiwa which was on bike paths all the way.  The cottage also has a great outdoor shower which is perfect for ending a trip to the beach.\r\n\r\nWaialua is the real Hawaii, it is quiet and away from most of the touristy stuff and it was very nice not to be in Wakiki!  But still only a short drive to historic Haleiwa which has restaurants and shops.  I cooked for myself most evenings in the cottage which was easy enough on the hot plate and the cottage was very peaceful in the evening, with fantastic starts to be watched from the garden after dark.   Bobby also brought me fresh pineapple from the plantation and the mangos at this time of year were so delicious- another fantastic touch!\r\n\r\nI'd really recommend staying with Bobby if you are looking for a peaceful, North Shore, real Hawaii stay.  It was absolutely fantastic-and the bed is massive and super comfortable!  Great value and really super!   Bobby is a great host, she was really welcoming and always contactable but left me to my privacy too.  She went out of her way to help me get some mail I was expecting and had great recommendations about the area. "

We met Bobby the first day and she even greeted us with a delicious pineapple. I loved waking up to the birds chirping outside and there was a secluded beach within walking distance. Really enjoyed the solitude of staying in the North Shore as opposed to the craziness of downtown or Waikiki. It's only a 35min drive if you do go into the city but it can take longer during rush hour. Definitely go to Haleiwa which is only a 5min drive and stop at the Paalaa Kai Bakery on your way into town for Snow Puffies and other fresh delicious bakery items. Thank again Bobby for a relaxing week on Oahu!"

Mom's only complaint was the roosters crowing all night--she didn't get much sleep due to this, although it's not Bobby's fault. Highly recommend this rental; would book again! "

Located on the beautiful North Shore, this rental is peaceful and perfectly situated to allow you to have an amazing time exploring the island. Very close to Ka'ena Point, where we saw wild whales migrating off the coast, and to the lovely surf town of Hale'iwa. There's a secluded beach in close walking distance, and we also used our rental car to explore some of the incredible beaches within a short drive, like Waimea Bay. The space itself was clean and well-equipped, with a very comfortable king size bed! Bobby was very easy to communicate with and we felt so well taken care of, right down to the arrival treats that were left for us (very appreciated after a long flight!). I'll echo what some others have mentioned here, which is to bring earplugs for nighttime sleeping, as there are junglefowl all over the island (wild chickens!) and the roosters do like to announce their presence at all hours - you'll hear this everywhere you go. I highly recommend this Airbnb rental! It was perfect for our trip and we couldn't be happier."

The cottage was so peaceful and relaxing. I was so happy with how private the space was. Just like the ad described, it has its own driveway and completely private space, the adjacent houses were even separated by a fence.  The space was clean, comfortable, and well stocked with games, towels, snacks, and other supplies. I wish we didn't have to run around so much that weekend so that we could have enjoyed the cottage more. We didn't even get to cut open the fresh pineapple that Bobby left for us! Although I did enjoy the crackers and peanut butter :) \n\nThis is the perfect weekend getaway for locals, or vacation spot for out of towners looking for a peaceful getaway. If you want to be be closer to the hustle and bustle, then I would look for a place closer to Haleiwa or Sunset. It is pretty quiet here (minus the roosters in the am), and other than the beach, it is not really walking distance to much. Which we loved actually :) Also, I really appreciated that Bobby was readily available to help with directions and check-in details, but more importantly that she gave us privacy and space once we checked in. \n\nIf I ever need to come back up the North Shore for a relaxing weekend, I would certainly book again! Highly recommended!"

But if you did want to make meals at home, all the basics are at hand to do so. \n\nBobby left us some graperfruits, eggs and chocolates which was a nice welcome. There were also two bikes for the use of guest - great for nipping down to the beach with. \n\nIf you want something simple and away from the main town, this place is ideal "

The bungalow is clean, open, and roomy, with a giant, comfortable California King size bed in the middle and a kitchen housing all the essentials (glasses, plates, silverware, coffee maker, ice trays, etc.). \n\nThere is also a television and WiFi available, which we used to connect to Spotify for some music. But oh, the sounds, the sounds, the sounds!\n\nI actually chose this reservation because of the reviews which described the sounds of the North Shore. I love chickens and birds and grew up with their gentle AM serenades, therefore this place was perfect. The roosters sang to impress while other birds crooned and cackled, creating a beautiful medley of island sounds that makes this place unique.\n\nThere is a giant yard and private gate on the outside of the bungalow, and an outdoor shower which was perfect for hosing off all the sand from the luscious beach. \n\nAnd the beach, what a beach it was! Upon arrival Bobby and her partner greeted us with a fresh pineapple and gave us directions to the ocean and encouraged us to use their cruiser bicycles. The beach is about a ten-minute walk or a three-minute bike ride -- either journey is pleasant, with the bike ride maybe being better because it gets you there faster.\n\nPicture all the noise and umbrellas and kayaks and floaties of Waikiki Beach, and all the surfers and gatherers of those at say, Banzai Pipeline, and then picture the exact opposite. The beach in this spot was quiet, with gentle, clean waves and at most I saw a maximum of about eight other people who were either snorkeling or just hanging out with dogs.\n\nAt one point, after relaxing on the beach for so long, my partner and I took a nap and were awakened by a friendly pooch named Tucker, who was all smiles as we gave him pets and ear scratches (sorry if that was TMI, we are dog people after all).\n\nI could yam on and on about this place, but I think I've done all the yamming I could possible yam.\n\nI give this place ten stars out of five, and the hosts also ten stars out of five.\n\nDid I mention we really enjoyed our stay?"

If you are looking for more of an adventure and want to truly experience the north shore I highly suggest staying here.

The pictures don't do it justice as the place is much bigger in person and has a great outdoor area and shower. Bobby was great as a host, very accommodating and quick to respond. My boyfriend and I truly felt at home here and cannot wait to rent from Bobby again. "

The king sized bed was comfortable and the house included some great amenities such as beach towels and toys, a nice sized tv and an outdoor shower to clean up from the beach which was a 5 minute walk away. It was also super helpful to have access to our own washer and drier during the trip. Bobbys cottage is located 5 minutes drive away from some of the best food on the island as well!  We took the advice of previous guests to bring some ear plugs for the wild chickens and didn't have a single issue with being woken up. Bobbys place is the place to stay on Oahu and we can't wait to come back some day.   Thanks again bobby!"

The bungalow had all the necessities for our 10 day stay. Laundry facilities were handy. The bed was so comfortable and the noise of the birds at 5am was like nature's alarm clock. Wifi worked flawlessly, which everyone seems to need these days. All in all the Banyan bungalow is a quiet, centrally located, well appointed base for exploring the North Shore, or all of Oahu for that matter "

I liked that I could walk to a beautiful neighborhood beach that was never crowded and that There were Sea Turtles swimming.\nI enjoyed taking a ride on the Beach Cruiser that is there for the guest. Fresh fruit was in the Fridge to start my stay. The Bungalow is very private with your own private driveway and very safe. Roosters run wild and are very noisy,earplugs do help but I have experienced this anywhere I have stayed in Hawaii on the countryside."

For people wanting to be away from all of the tourists  and enjoy secluded beaches and some nice hiking trails, this is  a great location.\n\nThe location is off the beaten track and is much less touristy than areas that you might visit in Honolulu. I heard the sounds of birds that I don't think I've heard before (not to mention some boisterous roosters :- ) ).\n\nThere is access to a couple of bikes on the premises and there is a rather long stretch of bike trail that runs  along the road if you want to check out the town. I was able to find the access road to the beach while out on a bike as it is easy to drive by it and not see it.\n\nBobby is very responsive to texts and gave good directions to the place."

It is close to the beach and a very short drive to the heart of the North Shore in Haleiwa and the beautiful beaches beyond.  The host provided beach towels and two bikes for cruising around.  Also nice to have access to a washer and dryer. It was my first visit to the North Shore and this was a great introduction.  The location is somewhat in the country and there are birds and chickens so you should bring your ear plugs, but I slept soundly (and the host provided ear plugs though I brought my own).  And while it is well equipped with a number of fans and plenty of windows to catch the breeze, there is no air condition, and it does get warm inside by the afternoon if that bothers you."

The place is very well decorated, a nice large bed and enough room to really make you feel at home. Very private setting, including private access and parking.\nThe host was very accomodating and communication was nearly immediate. In fact, on our last morning I texted to let her know we'd be going for a quick snorkle at Wiamea Bay (15 min drive) and back by 9:30 to check out at 10. She was gracious enough to allow for a later checkout which turned out to be marvelous. \nYou must have a car to stay here. No public transportation available and Uber would be potentially challenging.\nThe beach at the end of the street (down the street, take a right for a short distance) was fantastic for a semi-private location with good swimming. The water is fairly shallow with ok snorkeling. Bikes had flat tires so we drove. Not a huge deal. \nThe Roosters - I have to say that as charming as the chickens and chicks are that roam the North Shore (we have some at home), the roosters are quite challenging in the mornings, and for certain guests, this could be a deal breaker for this particular location. We did have one night that a couple in the neighborhood tested their vocal cords at 3:30 am for a few minutes. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I wanted to strangle a few of them, but we were up and going each morning anyway so this wasn't a deal breaker for us. \nWe loved this location and would stay again."

It's close enough to the action of the North Shore, but just far enough to get some peace and quiet at night. Bobby includes a lot of water gear for plenty activities at the beach. The house is clean, comfortable and allows a lot of privacy from neighbors. Would definitely book again when I return!"

You don\u2019t spend your day in your room, so don\u2019t worry about the a/c. \n\nI highly recommend, if you like a country setting. "

No AC, so it can be hot and steamy even with windows and fans (depending on time you visit). Bobby was super flexible and communicative which was very appreciated. The bikes were great, we rode those to the beach and into the main town of Haleiwa (about 5 miles). They provide a lock so it allowed us to adventure and get some breakfast. We couldn\u2019t find the snorkel gear people mentioned so we rented some. A few bugs, but it was likely due to the rain before our stay. I would still stay here again knowing what to expect this time."

It was pretty hot while we were there, but the fans helped us sleep comfortably for the most part.  The house was clean and stocked with beach towels, as well as other amenities.  The beach is just steps away from the house, and we rode our bikes there to enjoy an almost private beach.   Bobby was fast at communicating and was willing to help with whatever we needed. I highly recommend Bobby's place for anyone wanting a quiet, Hawaiian country experience."

They offered so many amenities with their rental (bicycles (3 total), there were snack and beverages in the refrigerator, extra towels, and they had provided a twin mattress for my daughter (7 years old)). \n\nThey were so very welcoming and accommodating from check in to check out. This location was perfect for a wedding we had out in Waialua over the weekend, it was no more than a 5 minute drive as opposed to an hour and a half long drive back home. \n\nI'm so very thankful for their hospitality and their generosity during our stay!!! If you're looking for a quaint, private, isolated home away from home, this place is definitely worth your stay!"

There is a separate, gated driveway to the bungalow with a ton of outdoor space and lawn furniture you can hang out in.   I wasn't expecting how big the studio really is.  There are thoughtful decorations that make you believe someone has put a lot of time and thought into this place.  \nThe beach is beautiful and within about a 5 minute walk (10 if you stroll and take photos of all the flowers along the way.)  My second day, I took one of the 3 bikes provided and rode the way to Hale'iwa.  Just go out the driveway, turn left and take a right at the end of the street.  Beach access is along the way and a bike path eventually opens up and it's a lovely drive with mountains on one side and beach on the other. \nI didn't get to meet the hosts since I got in rather late, but check in instructions were sent to me and really easy to follow.   I loved everything about this place and should I find myself on Oahu again, I'll definitely be back to this bungalow."

Voltariamos com certeza para l\u00e1! Recomendamos com 5 estrelas! (OBS: tem uma escola ao lado que faz um pouco de barulho pelas 9h-9h30 a.m., nada muito alto a ponto de incomodar, tanto que n\u00e3o fez a menor diferen\u00e7a para n\u00f3s, mas para os dorminhocos que detestam qualquer ru\u00eddo fica essa informa\u00e7\u00e3o)."

Los dos con ba\u00f1o en suite hermosos y limpios. El living muy comodo, otro balcon al lado del living con una mesa que lo aprovechamos un monton y la cocina super completa re bien equipada y todo anduvo a la perfeccion. Hubo un problema que dejaron otros huespedes y nadie le aviso a liliane pero apenas nos comunicamos para avisarle que un ventanal no cerraba bien vino a los minutos con el personal de mantenimiento y lo arreglo. Super agradable y atenta, es para destacarlo. Despues no hubo ning\u00fan problema, la pasamos hermoso, esta ubicado re cerca de la playa y a nada del centro de ipanema donde comes y podes conseguir lo que quieras. El barrio es precioso! Sin dudas volveria y lo recomiendo\nGracias liliane por la hospitalidad!"

Uma consequ\u00eancia disso eh que tive que gastar 30 euros com liga\u00e7\u00f5es telef\u00f4nicas usando um chip franc\u00eas quando cheguei no aeroporto para me comunicar com ela e perguntar coisas b\u00e1sicas que n\u00e3o foram informadas: n\u00famero da rua, com quem pegar\u00edamos a chave, o hor\u00e1rio em que poder\u00edamos entrar etc\n- al\u00e9m disso, apesar de ter usado o Airbnb in\u00fameras vezes, essa \u00e9 a primeira vez que ningu\u00e9m nos recebeu. N\u00e3o vimos a anfitri\u00e3 ou a ag\u00eancia que ela contrata ou outra pessoa em nenhum momento. N\u00f3s chegamos, pedimos as chaves ao porteiro, a maneira de abrir a garagem, onde estacionar, por onde entrar quando chegamos da praia etc. Fomos perguntando quando as d\u00favidas surgiam pq ningu\u00e9m nos fez uma apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o do lugar. Eles vendem um servi\u00e7o como se fosse um produto, e sem muito atendimento ao cliente.\n- o lugar estava empoeirado. Nitidamente ningu\u00e9m realizou uma limpeza previa \u00e0 nossa chegada. N\u00e3o era nada gritante,  mas bolas de poeira e sujeira no ch\u00e3o do quarto e embaixo dos m\u00f3veis podiam ser vistas com facilidade\n- a cafeteira estava quebrada, e como eu n\u00e3o tinha muita esperan\u00e7a de que algu\u00e9m se dispusesse a ir at\u00e9 l\u00e1, resolvi comprar uma cafeteira por 80 reais, que depois deixamos com familiares no RJ. O objetivo n\u00e3o era de compr\u00e1-la, mas devido aos fatos expostos acima fizemos um c\u00e1lculo de custo/benef\u00edcios e nos resignamos na compra de uma cafeteira que n\u00e3o precisar\u00edamos depois\n- o ar condicionado dos quartos tem apenas dois modos: desligado ou frio glacial, o que nos for\u00e7a a ligar e desligar constantemente pra manter uma temperatura razo\u00e1vel, inclusive no meio da noite. Em um dos quartos ele \u00e9 bem barulhento. O ar condicionado da sala tamb\u00e9m tem dois modos apenas: desligado ou fraquinho, o que \u00e9 particularmente chato quando se est\u00e1 na cozinha quente que n\u00e3o se resfria com ele (a cozinha \u00e9 americana e d\u00e1 sobre a sala)\n- por \u00faltimo, mas isso \u00e9 menos importante pq a piscina fecha cedo, quando algu\u00e9m nada nela uma das varandas treme bastante, o que reverbera sobre o quarto, fazendo um barulho como se algu\u00e9m no andar de cima estivesse pulando.\n\nEm resumo, o apartamento em si \u00e9 bom, mas a aus\u00eancia quase total de manuten\u00e7\u00e3o e algu\u00e9m pra auxiliar com coisas t\u00e3o simples como apresentar o lugar, informar hor\u00e1rios, dizer o endere\u00e7o exato, dizer as regras do lugar, substituir uma cafeteira quebrada ou limpar o apartamento de vez em quando faz com que ele esteja caro para o servi\u00e7o prestado.\n\nEsperamos ter ajudado outras pessoas a tomar uma escolha s\u00e1bia, e tamb\u00e9m esperamos que a anfitri\u00e3  se torne mais presente na plataforma e pressione a ag\u00eancia que ela contrata para melhorar determinados pontos do servi\u00e7o proposto.\n\nDanilo & Marine"

I enjoyed my morning tea and fruit provided by Leslie on the deck with a quintessential Australian view; a kookaburra sitting on a nearby television aerial and the Manly ferries on the harbour. A perfect way to start the day! We would love to return and I recommend anyone considering staying to do so."

While noises of upstairs and neighbour's dogs was audible on occasion, it did not affect our stay. Beds were comfortable and we still got a good night's rest.  The TV entertainment and wifi access was helpful and the stunning views overlooking the sails is second to none!! Leslie's complimentary breakfast was exceptional and her and her family made our stay feel like home - if not, better than our home in fact! Thank you again! "

The beds were comfy and warm.  Loved the spare toothbrush - as I actually forgot to pack mine!  There are quite a few stairs to contend with but this is pointed out in the dossier (that I failed to read carefully).  Also a quiet neighbourhood.  Leslie responded to any query we had very quickly.  A very good first up Airbnb experience."

We were there for three days. Leslie was a very thoughtful host, leaving wine and chocolates in the fridge, and even brought by Band-Aids for me when I got a really bad blister from my new shoes. \n\nDOWNSIDES:\nAs mentioned in previous reviews, the basement holds moisture. As long as you keep using the de-humidifier, you\u2019ll be okay. \n\nA major problem we had was Sydney\u2019s inconsistent public transit, more specifically the buses. If you\u2019re used to relying on transit, look for a place that is closer to the central parts of town. I think of all the buses we took, we had ONE arrive on time. Some showed up 10 minutes after the scheduled time, and one didn\u2019t even show up at all. So, look for something nearer the main harbour or CBD, or you can do like we did a lot of the time: walk down to the Manly Wharf (about 25 min walk) and take the ferry to the main harbour, and only stick to the areas that are closest. Honestly, take the ferries as much as possible. The views are phenomenal. They absolutely -made- the trip for us!"

Two bathrooms felt like luxury (as did the king size bed), and the flat was super convenient to great restaurants (Mamasan and Avila were both tasty in their own ways, and right around the corner) and the beach. Shopping and tasty gelato (our kids were staunch advocates for the Messina Gelato) were only a slight stone's throw further away on Hall St. \r\n\r\nHaving coffee available in the morning was a particular treat (thank you again, Cat), and there were ample cookbooks to review if we had had the time to really use the kitchen. Communications with Cat were easy for checking in and out; we didn't need to trouble her during our visit because the replacement light bulbs were easy to find when one fixture burnt out. We would definitely consider staying here again. "

Ready to offer us assistance whenever. The heating in the house was great during winter and the wifi was fantastic! The check in process was quick. The kitchen and pantry were really well stocked and the houses was prepped to perfection with small thoughtful things like an international plug adaptor that we had forgotten to bring. Thanks Cat for the lovely stay!! "

As a bunch of aged birdwatchers we didn't really fit in but felt comfortable and accepted anyway. Lots of shops and good restaurants within easy walking distance, and the beach is just as close. There's even a funky little nine hole golf course close by. It's perched on a cliff that overlooks the ocean and has million dollar views.\n\nThe house worked well for five adults (one couple and three others) and was clean and well appointed. There are even cookbooks displayed in the kitchen in case you wanted to get adventurous. One of the bedrooms is in a guesthouse in the back yard and it was a nice place for the couple to sleep and be apart form the others. Be prepared for visiting bugs, though.\n\nBelieve Cat when she says that you won't be able to park inside the gate without a high clearance vehicle but you will be able to park in the driveway if your car is on the small side. We had a minivan that was simply too big to allow for pedestrians pushing baby strollers to get by. Parking on the street is for two hours only and the nearest long-term free parking is s few blocks away. Remember to always leave space between you and the next car as locals seem to have no issue with pinning you in if you don't. \n\nCat was great about communicating with us. She seemed available at all times, promptly answering any questions that we had.\n\nEric\nVancouver, WA \nUSA"

It's also close to the stadiums and Bondi Junction shopping centre.\nI would recommend this property for a relaxed stay. Thank you Cat!"

The space is large and the main house shower was spectacular. The bedrooms and living space are large. The small touches were nice - there was coffee available which was huge, and the hair dryer available worked really well (long haired Airbnbers know how important this is)! \n\nCat was an amazing host, and was extremely responsive. The outdoor spade was lovely and the fish are a great touch. As someone who isn\u2019t used to seeing bugs often, the amount of bugs we saw was a bit alarming, but Cat took care of this right away!"

Cat's place is a private oasis in  the heart of beach-chic Bondi, only three quaint blocks to the sand (which my four-year-old insisted on completing barefoot like the locals).  It's as hip as Brooklyn but with better weather than Los Angeles and a fraction of the people,  Everything you could want is in the kitchen, and many thoughtful extras in the bathroom.  We enjoyed reading on the front porch and dining al fresco in the garden. Cat was a responsive super helpful hostess with a nice vibe in keeping with the Bondi lifestyle.  Hope to return soon."

Very friendly, great communication and really thoughtful, unexpectedly offering us early check in and late check out because it was possible. \n\nThe house has a lovely friendly feel to it, and is as amazing as the pictures look, they are accurate.   Loved sitting in the beautiful courtyard, sipping champagne and enjoying the fish.\n\nSo many small attentions to detail.... having champagne stoppers, insect repellant and a really helpful guide to the house and how to navigate the surrounding areas. Lovely toiletries and an amazing open fire - yes I had the fire going, not because it was really cold, but because I love an open fire and this was one of the reasons I chose the property.  Cat was very accommodating with this and we had plenty of firewood. The fire burnt and drew well.\n\nGreat location. The house is a very easy walk to Bondi Beach, even for unfit me, and an even shorter walk to groceries, bottle shop, cafe and restaurants.\n\nParking is the only thing that is a bit awkward.  The listing description is accurate in this regard.  If you have a regular size car you will not be able to get into the driveway, which is such a shame.  We were able to get longer stay parking in other streets, but this obviously wasn't as convenient. It was doable though.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay and intend to stay there again."

It feels very cosy, the fire place is a great asset and while you're waiting for it to get going, you can warm up with the gas heater. As we were there in winter, the added heater in each room were a great help as was the hot water bottles :) The bath is so big and instant hot water aplenty!! All the local tips were a great help and we even managed to park our monster 4WD rented car in the driveway ;) \nA great holiday and we would be happy to return.\nThank you Cat."

We were able to cuddle up in the comfy couch after a day on the beach. \n\nWe are especially grateful for our experience here because we had to cancel our previous place at the rocks.  The host there was unaffected with our concerns. All of which were half heartedly addressed, if at all.  The house at the rocks where we stayed had a terrible mold problem. My poor son was having asthma attacks. \n\nLuckily, Cat was able to accommodate last minute and she was sure to deal with any concerns we had right away. But we didn\u2019t have any. Everything was great, you won\u2019t be disappointed."

My Wife and I just visited for our honeymoon and had a great time exploring Maui and relaxing on the Beach. \r\n\r\nThe location is a very quiet and peaceful area of the beach but still close to everything. We were able to see many sights and surrounding towns, yet get in beautiful beach time. The building and condo is well maintained, and the grounds are landscaped very nicely.  The sound of the ocean and the palm trees at night in the bedroom made for a relaxing way to fall asleep. There are all the needed beach necessities and the kitchen is well appointed. We also enjoyed listening to the Hawaiian Cd's that were available in the apartment. It was a good introduction to the Slack Key style and added to the ambiance.   \r\n\r\nDon't forget to take a walk to the farmer's market and Sugar Beach Bake shop. It was our favorite way to start the morning. There are several supermarkets / drug stores within a 10 minute drive or less should you need anything. \r\n\r\nWe hope to visit again someday soon! "

We enjoyed our early morning walks on Sugar beach. The condo is comfortable with a washer-dryer, a fully equipped kitchen in-case you get tired of eating outside and want to make your own meal. Safe and family-friendly property. "

The condo management were very nice and everyone staying there was very friendly.  Grounds are well kept.  My daughter loved playing in the pool with other children.  We enjoyed having a washer and dryer in the unit.  During the day when we were there, we just left windows and door open because the cross breeze was so nice. Many others did the same. The ocean waters on this side of the island are calm, especially in the morning.  So we enjoyed swimming and riding the waves during the day.  We loved morning walks along the beach and watching the sunset. The beach was not crowded and we really appreciated the beach chairs and beach towels provided by owners. We also appreciated the designated parking space. Condo had everything we needed for a wonderful Maui vacation.  We highly recommend this budget friendly rental. I would rather stay here than a high priced hotel condo."

Our kids had a lot of fun there !! Sergio, a friend of Jos\u00e9 welcame us with such a kindness... Really! If you want to visit Porto and you love the ocean Matosinhos is the place to be and this apartment is the place to rest !! Thanks for everything Jos\u00e9 and Sergio and thank you most of all for your kindness !!!"

Atendi\u00f3 una llamada nuestra enseguida y nos despidi\u00f3 a la hora concertada, todo con amabilidad y en espa\u00f1ol. El piso est\u00e1 en una playa tipo surfista, en primera l\u00ednea y delante tiene la l\u00ednea del autob\u00fas que te lleva al centro de Oporto bordeando el mar y el r\u00edo. Tambi\u00e9n a unos cuantos metros puedes coger el metro que te deja en la parte alta del centro de Oporto pero es bastante ruidoso.\r\nEl piso est\u00e1 muy bien para los que quieren combinar playa con ambiente de la ciudad de Oporto.\r\nNosotros \u00edbamos en familia con ni\u00f1os (12-14) y nos encaj\u00f3 bien. Pasamos un par de d\u00edas en Oporto (pateada, paseo en barco, funicular, telesf\u00e9rico, tranv\u00eda...) y otros dos en Matoshinos y en Leca da Palmeira (surf, piscinas de mar, ba\u00f1os...). El agua del mar fr\u00eda, conviene neopreno.\r\nBueno, que hemos pasado unos d\u00edas estupendos y entretenidos.\r\nFelicidades a los portugueses por hablar ingl\u00e9s y m\u00e1s o menos espa\u00f1ol y hacerse entender. Gracias, algunos deber\u00edan aprender de este pa\u00eds."

The bus stop A21 to the airport is also within 6 minutes walking. \r\n2) Very convenient for shopping.\r\n3) Personal space and privacy is guaranteed for guests: I felt convenient and relaxed while staying here.\r\n4) patient, considerate and friendly hosts: Crystal and her husband are of great help and they are very easy to get along with. When I were leaving, they noticed that I got two pieces of  heavy luggage. They helped me take it to the bus station and saw me off. As a first-time traveler to Hong Kong and a Main-lander, I thank Crystal and her husband for offering me such a pleasant experience."

Her and her husband greeted us with smiles and showed us around their place. They thought of everything for their guests - including a power adapter! In addition to their bathroom and kitchen, we enjoyed the extra amenities their place provided like the work out facility and yoga room. Hopefully we will be back when it is warmer to use the pool! Great location in walking distance to many shops and restaurants - fun area of Hong Kong. Thanks again Crystal!"

Even prepared card holder of various member cards for our use since they know we wouldn't have. They also provide us some useful tips and very responsive in text and able to give us the help we need. Thankful for that. \r\n\r\nReally good location to stay in and MTR is just 5mins walk away which is just a straight route. We can start shopping once we get out of the building. It's a waste we didn't had time to use the facilities.\r\n\r\nThe only con part would be the room is really small. It only allow us to open one big luggage (29' inch) at a time. But the room itself is pretty cozy and clean! :) \r\n\r\nOverall it's a good stay, wouldn't mind booking their place when I visit HK again!"

We highly recommend this room for anyone visiting Hong Kong."

Also crystal had informed us that she wont be around during a certain time a few days earlier but we'd left for macau/hong kong just a day before she sent us a email, which made things worse, as none of us had bought the local sim card and i didnt check my email. And since we didnt know which flat she was stayign in, we couldnt even tell the guards there, for them to allow us go up. when we asked the guard if there was wifi at the lobby, sadly there was none so we couldnt get into airbnb. so we had to get the local sim card and connect to the internet so i could check my email. thank god her husband mike, left his contact number and flat number via email. basically the timing was so wrong. cant entirely blame it on crystal.  otherwise everything was good. the space was a bit small, location is walking distance from Mongkok East station. So that was really good for moving around. Hardly got to meet crystal but her husband mike was always around  in the evenings. so, he gave us quite a tip to take a cab to go to the airport rather than taking the MTR especially if you have luggage. \r\n\r\nmain tip: take the train to mongkok east, and check your email/airbnb a day before and on the day of arrival in hong kong for updates your host has left for you.

The place has a gym and a pool and feels like a 5 star hotel. The room and bed are small but this is too be expected in Hong Kong and it's more than enough. The hosts were lovely and really got us out of a pickle with speedy replies and instant book even though it was late."

I stayed for 10 nights with the majority of my time out, and tippy toeing back in anywhere between midnight and 5am! The room itself is small, but very typical of Hong Kong with air con (a must in humidity of 80%). \r\nThe block in which the tower is in is clearly very well looked after and very classy - it even has a gym and swimming pool on the 5th floor which I used once. \r\nWhen I stayed they had a newborn baby, which I have to say didn't have the lungs or the crying capacity to make any noise whatsoever. It was more silent than me. \r\n\r\nI didn't make much use of the flat as a whole, but stayed mostly in my room. Have to say, I really liked the husband as did my friend. Really decent guy - just hospitable and someone you can see yourself going out with. Top people and exactly what this website is about. "

No matter you wanna go to Hong Kong Island or the New Territories, it's very convenient. We are also glad to find various shops and restaurants near the apartment. Moreover, the outdoor swimming pool is fantastic!  And our host is really a lovely couple. The only shortcoming is that the room is a little bit small. But that's Hong Kong, so we feel it acceptable."

Crystal and her husband were very nice and friendly and tried to provide everything we needed. They have a newborn baby, so I would suggest bringing a pair of ear plugs."

The room itself is small but cozy, with quality furniture and ergonomic bedding. For single travelers, this is an easy choice; less so for couples (due to space). Do note, however, that since there is an infant, washing machine is not available for guests to use."

        "comments": "Our stayed at Crystal's house was ok. They allowed us to leave our luggage before check-in time and after check-out time which was great as we didn't need to carry our bags during the last day before going to the airport. Also, the house looks perfectly the same as it looks in the pictures. The room is small but enough for one-two nights in Hong Kong. The most important thing is that everything was clean and we rest 100% in the room provided. The only thing we are disappointed with is that we couldn't have a chat with them and it could have been a great help for our visit in Hong Kong giving us some tips about the city. That's how Airbnb works, experience in a local house to share a small chat or even a coffee but it wasn't nothing like that. Anyway, in general, we are happy with our stayed."

It is a newly developed condo located at one of the prime locations of the city, with access to all amenities you can imagine. Besides, I am particularly impressed with the lobby and property management service. \n\n\nThe room is not big, but quiet and comfortable. And Lung is an amazing host who's always there to offer help and advice.  \n\n\nI would definitely choose Lung's apartment again. My rating is \"strongly recommend\". "

The room is not very big and the bed was quite small and a bit hard but for a short stay it is totally sufficient. Lung was always there for our questions and very helpful. Kitchen and bathroom are also clean and nice. The location of the apartment is great with 5 minute walk to 2 MTR stations and some markets in the neighborhood."

It is a fairly new building with an impressive entrance reception hall. It is safe as there are receptionists there at all hours, and with security pass needed to get through to the elevtors. Room is fairly compact but is adequate.\r\n\r\nYou can literally find whatever you need in the area with hundreds of restaurants, foodstalls, clothing , shoes, electronics and inexpensive goodies along the streets.

It's very close to lots of restaurants especially if you enjoy local street food.  It's safe as there's 24/7 security in the building.  Last but not least, the hosts (Both Mike and Crystal) are super nice and friendly.\n\nYes, the room is quite small but it's common in HK.  It should be sufficient for 1-2 people."

Cath was a welcoming and attentive hostess who was not only knowledgeable and helpful with all our queries, but provided a wonderful breakfast hamper with home made goodies that really made us feel welcome. The garden setting and chooks only added to our experience. We loved the location and enjoyed exploring the adjoining areas such as Newtown and Surry Hills.\r\nThoroughly recommended."

We arrived and were greeted by the very friendly and attentive Cath - who introduced us to the chickens on the way to the studio. As soon as we stepped inside we felt comfortable. The decor is modern, quirky and stylish, there is a lovely area to sit and watch television, a user friendly kitchenette, a comfortable bed and a clean and modern bathroom. Cath provided us with a lovely array of breakfast and snack options and she even baked a delicious loaf of fresh bread which she left at our doorstep the following morning along with a newspaper. There is a large collection of DVD's to watch and books to read and the studio is in a quiet location with plenty parking - also within easy walking distance of public transport. I highly recommend The Garden Studio to anyone looking for a private, convenient and comfortable place to stay. My partner and I will definitely be returning in the future. "

Cath is a very smiling and nice person. The studio is fully adjust to feel like home.\r\nThe basket for breakfast is really complete and everything is thinked that we lacked nothing. Moreover it was a pleasure to be able to taste the delicious biscuits and bread, all home made by Cath. The bus stations and shops are close and there are only 15 minutes walking to go to the station Petersham.\r\nI really recommend Cath's studio !"

The studio is in a quiet neighborhood, it's perfect to relax after a busy day in the city.\r\nThis was a 5 star experience, I would book again anytime. Thank you for a lovely time, Cath!\r\nVery best,\r\nDaniela"

Why I'd recommend you stay:\r\n\r\n* Lots of privacy, with your own entrance...\r\n\r\n* Cath is a very generous, understanding, and thoughtful host, and easy to contact. We particularly loved her guides about where to eat in the local area.\r\n\r\n* TGS is very well located in the central suburb of Marrickville - easy to get into the CBD/Newtown/Surry Hills, and if you drive like me, never any complications with street parking!\r\n\r\n* The studio was meticulous, and very well stocked - Cath filled the fridge/kitchen with nearly everything you'd need... The variety of teas and delicious homemade cookies were mostly appreciated, and I'm sure most Airbnb users are interested in an espresso machine, which was also available!\r\n\r\n* The shower in this place is truly amazing.\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you don't mind a smaller place, this is the place for you - we found it worked well for 2 people. Thank you again Cath. :-)"

Handed a loaf of baked bread straight from the oven within moments was an unexpected delight. The beautifully styled and thoughtfully prepared space is ideal. We felt that the attention to detail was the best we have experienced using AirBNB. From the generously stocked fridge and hamper, bathroom items, games, videos and books and even picnic gear it was clear the stylish owner is well travelled and knows how to make a space a temporary home. The kitchenette has everything you need. In fact the space and the lovely courtyard was so delightful we surprised ourselves by spending the first morning there enjoying a lazy breakfast reading the terrific range of wonderful magazines rather than head out. The location is great. At the end of the street is a lovely park where we were able to fit in a morning run. Very comfy bed, quality linen, a super quiet fan. Great information and maps were a welcome addition. We would love to return here and most likely will. Highly recommended. "

The studio has been cleverly designed and has a crispy clean, fresh, airy feel to it.  Cath was the perfect host who was there if I needed anything while also giving me a sense of privacy.  All your needs are met at The Garden Studio with extras of yummy home baked ginger biscuits and the morning paper delivered to your front door!  All this with a lush raindrop shower head made for delightful stay - it was a treat and a retreat all in one."

Everything is done to a really high quality level, from the sheets on the perfectly made bed to the spotless interior and the fantastic breakfast box Cath left for me.  The garden is a wonderful and quiet place to hang out, although it is definitely shared between you and the host.  Privacy feels more private that a room in someone else's house, but probably less than a stand-alone apartment - reasonable since it's a studio in someone's back garden.  The neighborhood is quiet and pretty, with nice cafes and a farmer's market a 15-minute walk.  Getting into and out of other places in the city takes a while; you are not in the center of things, but in a nice neighborhood.  A car or a bike would be more flexible than using transit.  Overall a great place that I would use again!"

I felt so comfortable staying there, that I completely forgot that it was located at the back of Cath's house. Cath has done an amazing job with making her guests feel welcome and well cared for. The breakfast hamper was beautiful (especially since I'm a fussy eater!!) fresh bread, home made jam, milk, juice, coffee, herbal teas etc etc was ALL provided. Being a tourist to Sydney, the information folder Cath has put together herself was extremely helpful. One night I tried one of her recommended restaurants and the food was amazing. I can't thank Cath enough for allowing me the privilege of staying in her beautiful studio."

While it is small it is very sunny and really well set out with modern furniture and we loved the loft bed.  The bathroom area has a shower curtain, not a door but that was not a problem for us. \r\nCath - thank you very much for making our stay so nice.  Your home baking left for us on one of the days was really thoughtful.  I highly recommend you and your Garden Studio.  \r\n"

A folder was available outlining all the local cafes, restaurants, hairdressers and any other professional you might need. Before we arrived Cath contacted us to ensure her breakfast hamper contained things we liked. In additional to the hamper, each day we were treated to a range of treats including fresh eggs, delicious cakes or freshly baked bread. Even the paper was delivered most days courtesy of Chips the guide dog in training. After eight days we rolled out of the Garden Studio wishing we could stay indefinitely. This standard was maintained with Cath being extremely busy with an enormous photo shoot as well as her impending wedding this weekend. What a wonderful find. We would definitely recommend Cath to our family and friends and in fact have done so,"

From fresh flowers down to oven-fresh bread and the newspaper at our doorstep the next morning. The fridge was well stocked with condiments, chocolates, juice, milk and more. Tea and coffee choices were plentiful. There was a book full of maps, tips on things to do and see, menus for local restaurants and other useful contacts. \r\n\r\nThe space was quiet with no traffic noise, just the cluck of the friendly chickens and someone playing piano in a nearby house (not intrusively!).\r\n\r\nThe location was great for us. Close to several parks and a short walk to Marrickville shopping strip, restaurants, bars (Gasoline Pony) and the train station was about 30 mins walk away. Parking was easy.\r\n\r\nCommunication was easy and prompt which made it easy to change our plans which we had to do at short notice.\r\n\r\nWe'd highly recommend The Garden Studio to guests wanting a peaceful stay close enough to the city."

The studio was fully equipped and beautifully styled. Our privacy was respected. We will definitely be staying again on our next Sydney visit. Thank you Cath "

There was enough room for two of us to stay but cosy enough to make it feel comfortable. Being in Marrickville, it is so handy to where we wanted to be. \r\n\r\nThe breakfast Cath provided was amazing, such great hospitality. My girlfriend says Cath really knows the way to a girl's heart as there were plenty of amenities included with the stay, even a hairdryer and shampoo/conditioner, not to mention the fully stocked kitchen. \r\n\r\nCannot recommend enough for either singles or couples. Cath made us feel very welcome yet with enough privacy that we felt comfortable. "

She left us to our own devices most of the time, but was always available and forthcoming with great advice about the area and very generous with her delivery of home-baked bread, a muesli slice that she made and fresh eggs from her cooks. Marrickville is a really nice area - very quiet and relaxed, but with plenty of dining options within a 15 minute walk and the city and Newtown also very accessible via public transport. Highly recommended!"

We could walk to more in the area than we even managed to do in the 3 days we were there (so there is no shortage of great food or entertainment). Even with an air mattress on the downstairs floor my friend and I felt we had plenty of room.  We'd stay there again in a flash. Next time we'll bring our nona trolleys, and cooler bags and shop up on goodies from the Greek deli and places on illawarra rd."

The studio is just like it is shown in the pics being even better than a hotel stay. It is fully equipped with everything you need and it has everything as described on the Airbnb site. We were blown away with the fresh and tasty eggs Cath provided us from her own chickens on site. Her breakfast hamper has fresh bread, yogurt, muesli, milk and other baked goods that was more than what we needed. Cath is very thoughtful and considerate of her guests and will provide you all the information required to travel, eat and be like a local which is what we wanted to do in our Sydney stay. We also loved her sense of style and the way she has done up the Garden studio. Also there is a lovely vegetable patch with herbs and greens right outside the studio. Very pretty.  The little details matter like the umbrellas, picnic basket, extra blankets, etc that were provided to us. The studio is not located within the CBD area but that was not a problem at all since we were commuting around via trains and buses and did not find any issues doing so. Also it is in a suburb very close to the central area so you are still pretty close. Besides Marickville has some of the best food and coffee options that we explored in our trip. Stay at the Garden studio and you will not be disappointed. We were sad to leave and only wished we could have stayed longer. This has surely been our best AirBnb stay till date. \r\n\r\nP.S. Just make sure you are okay to stay in a loft like bed with a movable ladder to climb up and down which may not suit everyone. That was a highlight for us though and we wanted to experience it :) "

We really enjoyed our stay with a yummy breakfast of cereal or fresh eggs (from the three beautiful chickens) and plenty of things to do. The apartment is perfect, short walk to the train or bus, and close to shops and restaurants. Highly recommended! Thanks Cath for a great stay!"

She's clearly got an eye for design because this place has been so cleverly done. \r\nShe left me beautiful homemade jam, fresh eggs from her gorgeous chickens, a chocolate eater egg, milk, a very generous selection of cereals ... she really knows how to make you feel welcome. \r\nThe cottage is very comfortable and it's completely private, fully equipped, comfortable bed, close to transport. There is nothing at all to fault. I really appreciate it so thanks Cath for a fantastic stay!"

Soaking up the morning sun with a cup of tea, a croissant and a good book - pure bliss. Cath sure knows how to make you feel at home, with fresh bread and a well-stocked kitchen. Oh, and a very comfortable bed! Pop down the road to Cornersmith Cafe for a delicious breakfast or read a book under the big trees in the park at the end of the street. I wish I could have stayed longer - I definitely plan to come back!"

Every little detail had been thought of, and the bountiful breakfast basket was a delight, as was the little delivery from the bread fairy the following morning, and the fresh eggs from the little chickies in the garden :) The location was great - a very comfortable walking distance to Newtown and Marrickville which meant we were able to enjoy the great food, coffee and beer that the locality has to offer, as well as great theatre at the Depot. Cath's recommendations for local must-dos were much appreciated. The street is lovely and quiet, with a park at the end. Getting to and from the train was also a breeze. This is a rare gem, one which we will definitely be returning to! "

Cath provided us with fresh bread and croissants for breakfast which was just the cherry on top of a wonderful stay. Cath is a friendly host who will assist you with anything you need.

This studio may not suit you if you're a light sleeper it has a lot of natural morning light and planes flying close by. Location is smack in the middle of 3 train lines all about 15mins walk away.\nNot super close to the city center, but good if you have a car to park and don't want to pay.\nThanks for a good stay!"

The breakfast hamper that is provided is a very thoughtful touch; cereal, muesli, baked beans, porridge oats, eggs, juice., freshly baked bread from the local bakery...Cath was also very accommodating with our dietary requirements-vegan- and provided us with almond milk, coconut yoghurt, dairy free margarine and coconut & chia puddings. \n\nFree parking outside was also a bonus and we never had any issues with finding a space.\n\nHighly recommend staying here!  \n"

We felt that Cath wants her guests feel really comfortable and happy in it. The breakfast basket with bread, eggs, milk and muesli made it complete. The Studio is not very big but it has everything which is needed. Very nice and lovely! a little treasury :)\n\nCath is very attentive, helpful and extremely pleasant. She was always reachable when we asked for insider tips or had questions concerning locations to visit. The \"cherry on top of the cake\" was that Cath brought us to the airport on our last day! Thanks again!\n\nSo for us it is not difficult to summarize that Cath (and her husband mark) are excellent \"super hosts\"! We loved the week in Marrickville and enjoyed the stay in the Garden Studio. Highly recommended!!! :)\n\nCath and Mark: Thank you very very much for being your guests! It was a great time in Sydney and your lovely Garden Studio. It was a pleasure meeting you!\n\nAnd: the next time you are in germany near to us... you already know... :)"

    "neighborhood_overview": "Great location will allow you to explore and enjoy Taksim, Pera,Galata , \u015ei\u015fhane and Cihangir. (great walking distance for all the events), Easily accessible to subway, tram, ferries. The neighbourhood is friendly and diverse. It is only 3 minutes by walk to the Galatasaray Square which is located approximately at the center of the Istiklal Avenue. Istiklal Avenue is located in the historic Beyo\u011flu (Pera) district, it is an elegant pedestrian street, 1.4 kilometers long, which houses boutiques, music stores, bookstores, art galleries, cinemas, theatres, libraries, caf\u00e9s, pubs, night clubs with live music, historical patisseries, chocolateries and restaurants.  You should definately walk through the local bazaar on Sunday right beside the apartment. You can find anything you need with cheap prices; fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, meat, dairy products! Local bazaars will be very helpful to understand the culture of Turkish people as well. There are couple of restaurants close by where yo",
    "notes": "From/To Airports: There are several ways to get from the airport to the apartment, but the most convenient manner is to take \u201cHAVATA\u015e\" shuttle to Taksim Square departing every 30 minutes from the airport (from both airports- Atat\u00fcrk and Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en). As you may be unfamiliar with the area, I am happy to come and pick you up in front of Galatasaray Highschool (on Istiklal Street) which is 10 minutes walk from Taksim Square where you will get off. I can always advise you cheaper public transport options if you ask for. Useful information: You can rent the apartment/room for (a) day(s), week, month or longer periods of time.  There is various supermarkets conveniently situated a block away from the apartment on the way to Istiklal street, also a small kiosk right next to the apartment and a laundry in 100 meters distance.",
    "transit": "Getting around by Walk, Subway, Bus, Tram, Ferry, Tunnel: You can take one of the world's oldest tram on Istiklal street by 3 minutes walk from the apartment on Istiklal street. By tram you can end up in Istanbul\u2019s Tunnel (T\u00fcnel) which is the world\u2019s shortest and third-oldest passenger terminal. This one-stop funicular climbs the steeply uphill for 500 meters from Karak\u00f6y to T\u00fcnel and the other way around. Karak\u00f6y is today a major transport hub for intercity and also a house of unique cafes and galleries. We can count Karak\u00f6y for the city's recent hip?? district. The Galata Bridge connects Karak\u00f6y with the Old City, on which the fast tram line Zeytinburnu-Kabata\u015f runs with. This tram line goes to Atat\u00fcrk Airport within 1 hour. Ferry boats run every 10 to 20 minutes from the ferry terminal on a pontoon to Haydarpa\u015fa train terminal and Kad\u0131k\u00f6y across the Asian shore of Bosphorus. You should definately walk throgh Kad\u0131k\u00f6y at day/night time. Many different tastes of joy. It is also only tw",

Although more people could potentially stay there we felt that it was perfect for four. It is fully equipped with everything necessary. We couldn't think of anything we would need that was missing. The location is great close to Istiklal street and a walking distance to many major attrcations. \r\nWe can warmly recommend Aybike and her apartment!\r\nBest regards,\r\nOksana, Victor, Liuda, Stas"

The flat is realy well equipted with everything needed for travelers and even some food left for the first snack. The location is good, near Istiklal street. Aybike was quick responcive. We had problems with hot water but it was solved quickly. Her mother was very polite and met us with  homemade sweet cookies. Every person were provided with set of towels for face and body. They were new, soft and clean. The streets are very nosy but when tired it doesn't metter :). I would like to come again and highly recommend it. Good luck and thank you Aybike!"

Shops and a 24-hour local eatery were seconds away. Her apartment was clean, cosy, and packed with everything one would need - all kinds of household items, maps and tourist guides, Internet, snacks, etc. We were five adults, including 2 elderly. Aybike catered to all of us wonderfully, even dropping off a fan when we mentioned that the elders were feeling a bit hot. Throughout our stay she was always responsive on (Hidden by Airbnb) and regularly gave advice regarding our Istanbul adventures. Even after we left, she informed us of an item we had left behind, and offered to help send it to us. Please visit us in Dhaka, Aybike!"

Both the bedrooms however have little natural light, so if this is important to you it might not be your best choice. There were some plumbing issues which were frustrating.  Aybike was quick to respond to concerns, though nothing could be done right away. Hopefully issues will be resolved quickly for the next guest. "

We were a group of four and we slept very comfortably amd enjoyed being at home resting after our long walks in what is probably the best city we have ever been. Her house is cosy, very nicely decorated, with hot water at all times and very interesting books to read if you feel like relaxing on the coach ;). Aybike was very helpful and arranged for our transportation in and out of the airport and was always available for anything we needed! Would highly recommend her home for your stay in Istanbul!"

For e.g. towels, blankets, pillows and so on...  Only one negativ point is that the flat is dusty on some spots and very loud because of the busy road in front of the house.. Anyways, it is also a dangerous area. You shouldn't walk alone in the nighttime. All in one: For a big group it is nice to stay here, because u can see the big city from another point and not only as a tourist."

The bed was very cosy and everything very clean. 3 minutes away from the Istiklal Caddesi where you can find everything to eat and drink or other possibilities to shop. I could not meet Aybike personally but her amazing mom received and welcomed me. Next time I visit Istanbul we will definitely have dinner together with her mom.  Although I did not meet Aybike she was available the whole time to help. \nThank you very very much, Aybike! Hope to see you next year!"

We were a party of 3 adults and 2 kids and had enough space to get comfortable. The apartment was clean, nicely decorated, and stocked with the necessities. The location perfect. You're right in the heart of a lively area and can walk to plenty of action (restaurants, attractions, bars, shopsetc) in 5-20 minutes. There is also a great 24 hour local restaurant directly across the street from the apartment. Aybike was quick to respond to any questions and provided very valuable recommendations. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic Istanbul experience."

        "comments": "We really enjoyed staying at Aybike!\nShe is a wonderful host, very welcoming and hospitable. We were met by her mother, but Aybike was always in touch. The apartment is cozy, has everything you need. Near the corner there is an excellent cafe with breakfast, and within walking distance of all the attractions of the city. We practically did not use public transport, walked all the time, although Aybike left us a pass. A bit noisy from the street, but I always have earplugs with me on trips, so I don\u2019t see any problems with that. And on the contrary, these are the sounds of the city, without them you will not taste it to the end :)\nOh, and Aybike helped us with the return transfer to Sabiha airport, was very clear and on time. Very grateful, our holiday was great thanks to Aybike, including :)"

She responded to all messages with questions about the apartment instantly, which was very helpful as we settled in.\nThe apartment is comfortable and has all you may need.  It is in a bustling city so expect some noise in the lounge area through the day and night.  A great atmosphere in the area and very close to the main touristic attractions."

        "comments": "Aybike is a wonderful host and she made sure to take care of all the things necessary for our easy arrival and departure. Commute from and to the airport was a breeze with a toddler because she took care of the booking of the transportation. She was also always responsive on (Hidden by Airbnb) and over phone. I might have expected her house to be slightly more than what I imagined from the pictures but it was comfortable and equipped nevertheless. So that wasn\u2019t a big deal. The location of the house is very close to the busy \u0130stiklal street and the bus stop \u2018\u00d6mer Hayyam\u2019 has frequent connectivity to \u2018Taksim Square\u2019 and Ominonu. The only downside we felt was we had to climb stairs to reach the bus stop and it was not fun to do so with a stroller to carry around. But without a stroller I\u2019d not have worried about this situation. Our 5 day stay was comfortable expect the continuous rain dampened spirit a bit. Her parents whom we met on the day we left were very sweet people. Overall I\u2019m thankful to Aybike for her hospitality and everything."

Good area with close distance to restaurants and subway. The only thing I\u2019d say is that street is kinda noisy so that if apartment would be packed it worth to bring ear plugs with you as only one room (which is close to window to street) sometimes is noisy. Otherwise that\u2019s more than you can expect! Aybike is great host! Thanks for hosting us. All the best!"

Has 24 hour food and  shops right outside the flat! Amenities are basic but suited us well. I would suggest taking slippers as the wooden floor is cold in winter,  leave the windows open to let in the hustle and bustle of Istanbul !! No balcony with a view, and there\u2019s a flight of winding stairs to get to the flat which isn\u2019t glamorous but the place is VERY safe!"

        "comments": "The best place to stay in Istanbul. The place is really near to Taksim Square. Once you get out from the house, you can just walk up around 5 minutes. Then, you will be at the Istiklal Street and it just 5 minutes walk to get to Taksim Square. Also, it is so nearby to Galata Tower too. It is easy to connect with public transportation as the metro station is just nearby. This place is also nearby to the Istiklal Street. The famous shopping street in Istanbul. So, I highly recommend this place to anyone out there when you want to visit Istanbul. Aybike is a very good host. She offered me a help if i had left something in Bursa. Well that was a really over the top of attitude. What an amazing person she is!"

Aun que no est\u00e1 en el mismo centro de la ciudad se llega a el en un paseo de poco m\u00e1s de 10 mins, adem\u00e1s en la misma puerta hay una parada de metro.

O condominio \u00e9 bem grande, fica na frente da praia mas tem uma pequena caminhada dentro dele pra chegar at\u00e9 a sa\u00edda. Nada longo se vc n\u00e3o estiver carregando muita coisa. A comunica\u00e7\u00e3o com a Paula foi maravilhosa. Ela sempre respondeu tudo muito r\u00e1pido e o acesso ao apartamento foi tranquilo. O fato de ter um cofre na porta de entrada ajuda muito se vc estiver viajando com outras pessoas. Assim a chave fica sempre guardada l\u00e1 para caso as pessoas cheguem separadas no apto. Muito funcional.\nA \u00fanica coisa que eu sugeri pra Paula \u00e9 ter toalhas. Chegamos l\u00e1 e n\u00e3o encontramos toalhas. Apenas roupas de cama. Mesmo o anuncio dizendo que o apartamento n\u00e3o tinha, essa informa\u00e7\u00e3o fica um pouco escondida em \"b\u00e1sicos\". S\u00f3 percebi que \"b\u00e1sico\" era toalhas, roupa de cama e sabonetes depois que cheguei. Isso atrapalhou um pouco. Mas, tendo isso em vista, tudo certo com todo o resto."

The room was clean, small but it's very hard to find a big room in Hong Kong. The apartment situation is very convenient, near shops, 7/11, restaurants, subway,... I recommend to stay there!\r\n I am an agent in Hongkong who help some travel to reservate apartment ,the above review is wrote by that apartment guest"

Location was very nice. Would definitely want to stay in the same area next time in town. Much nicer than staying on the Hong King island in my opinion with lots of markets and nice bars and cafe's right down the street. And also, Kwan was very helpful meeting us at the metro station and taking us to the flat. Make sure to install (Hidden by Airbnb) before you go!"

The condo was as expected, small bonuses included fresh local fruit and a coffee sample. The location is a plus, easy drive from airport and walking distance (10-15 minutes) from shops and restaurants in Hilo town. Doug was quick to respond to questions and concerns and very friendly.\n\nIt's not air conditioned like most units in Hawaii and since we live on Oahu we were prepared but it's good to know in advance. There are four tower fans throughout the unit that make it comfortable for relaxing and sleeping. \n\nOverall, I think it is a good value and I would recommend it. "

He was very communicative before our trip, delineating in great detail how to get in, what to expect, etc. The space itself was beautiful (really, the pictures don't do it justice), and it was incredible to fall asleep to the sound of the river rushing nearby.  We were comfortably close to restaurants, etc. in downtown Hilo, and a great in-between from Volcanoes National Park and the north Hilo coastal towns. Great stay! Wish I had planned my whole vacation based out of this spot. "

All the amenities for a comfortable stay. There is a creek right next to it and you can hear the sound which adds to the charm.

The kitchen is so well equipped, the bedding ia beautiful and so comfortable.  There are scents of candles throughout the house. Doug thoughtfully  provided some fruits and water for us. The WiFi works well and the condo is centrally located.  I would definately book again if i was ever in Hilo again."

Highly recommend Moon and Turtle for dinner and Zipline Through Paradise for a thrill and mostly staying at Doug's. The unit's ambience and style is indicative of Hilo's early architecture and Craftsman bungalows. Doug took much care in all the details and amenities. The exterior lacks curb appeal but once inside it's another world. The \"River\" View is more like a tropical jungle, a la Rousseau.  Parking is a breeze,  the steps... not too bad.  Location is close enough to town; short drive or nice long walk."

The apartment was tucked away from downtown, but within easy walking distance. It was much more roomier than described with a great layout, everything that you would need to comfortably stay and much more. The windows look out onto the stream as described.. but it was more like a being in a jungle house! with the rushing stream below, the canopy of the trees and noises from the frogs it truly felt like you were in an exotic jungle location. Everything went smoothly from check-in to check-out. We didn't end up using the pool, but did check it out. Hoping to be back to stay! Thanks!!"

Laudry room was a plus since we did some off roading (Champagne Ponds) and muddy hiking (Waipi\u2019o Valley). It was great to come back each evening to a nice comfortable spot.\n\nLoved the sounds of the stream and coqui frogs during dinner, really added to the ambiance.   \n\nFloor plan is very functional.\n\nWe had a wonderful time and i would highly recommend this place for parties of 3 or 4."

The apartment is very clean and stacked with absolutely everything we needed during our four-day stay (Deb was very kind to even arrange a play pen and a high chair for our baby!) Communication was extremely easy. Other guests mentioned, but I\u2019ll repeat it again - the river and forest right outside the windows is truly amazing. We slept wry well and had a relaxing stay. Thank you, Deb and Douglas!"

You have both privacy (not in actual downtown) but the convenience of being extremely close to the downtown area so you can easily walk to the market/shops/restaurants. The condo was fully stocked including linens and everything you would need in a kitchen. Doug was very responsive and kind, and even left us a welcome box of macadamia chocolates. The back patio was enclosed and perfect to sit and relax and play cards. Below the condo area is a small river so you constantly have the sounds of not only the river but the frogs at night, which I love! I would highly recommend staying at Doug\u2019s condo, it is wonderful!"

Everything in the condo worked as expected.

We can go to the city centre just by walking. Even though at night, we still feel safe to walk to the apartment from the metro.I strongly recommend people to stay there during staying in Barcelona. "

However,  Guillermo offered as an AC Unit when I mentioned it to him. Good restaurants/bars/coffee shops a few minutes walk away, and the subway is 2/3 minutes walk too.

Quite far east in Williamsburg - 30min walk to main Williamsburg strip but 5 minute walk to the nearest subway, with a couple of bars and coffee shops along the way. Very easy to get across to Manhattan. Only downside was no decent convenience store - closest one was very expensive and didn't have everything we were looking for. Otherwise lovely stay and would highly recommend. "

Bed was very comfortable (on the softer side which we like) and bed linens and towels were nice. We did a lot of walking during the day so it was good to be able to get a takeaway and relax with Netflix and feel like we were at home in the evening. The apartment is close to two stations on the L train, four stops into Manhattan and connected with all the north/south lines, very easy to get around. I think if you haven't stayed in New York before and aren't that adventurous you would probably find this a little too out the way. For those who have visited Nyc before and comfortable finding their way around this is fantastic value and interesting to stay outside of Manhattan. Recommend swallow cafe for breakfast. We also went to Rye for dinner. We used Uber in the evenings if we were eating out elsewhere in Brooklyn for convenience. \r\nThanks,\r\nLouise "

The location was great, so close to the subway and within walking distance/easy underground ride to plenty of cool cafes, restaurants and coffee shops. A great base to explore NYC and Brooklyn. The apartment was amazing, very spacious and modern. Much better than a tiny hotel room. Check out Guillermos recommended places to eat. A great tip is to buy a 7 day metro pass for about $30 which will get to anywhere by underground or bus. We got a taxi from Jfk because it was late night but on the way home we found it very easy to get the train. "

        "comments": "Firstly, it is important to note that we stayed at Guillermo's place for 1 month. This could make some issues irrelevant for people who intend to stay for a few days to 1 week. \n\nHost:\nGuillermo is a very considerate host and genuinely wants guests to have a great stay. His communications are very quick and he is also very quick in responding to any issues. He is a really nice guy and trustworthy. He personally responds to issues and even got us a microwave oven on request, which was very kind of him. \n\nNoise:\nOne issue we had with the apartment is noise. This is obviously nothing to do with the host but it can't really be ignored in a review. There is a cement factory right behind the apartment and a welders/metal works opposite it. This is going to make noise. Both start work very early in the morning so we often were woke up by the beeping of trucks reversing and the grinding of the metal works across the road. They both work 6 days a week. Probably not an issue for a few days but having that noise every morning for a month is annoying. \n\nArea:\nThe area (Bushwick) is very different to Williamsburg even though some people call it East Williamsburg. Bushwick is more like real life. Good variety of people and cultures and we found it very safe. Plenty of amenities close by. Getting into Manhattan is very simple. L train is 5 stops away from East Village which is great. Bushwick has artists' residence and an amazing Pizza place called Roberta's, which is a must. There is very impressive street art (lots of it) about 5 minutes away. \n\nRooms:\nThe bathroom is new and everything works well. Kitchen is ok but a little limited. We did have some issues with the power going a couple of times in there. It does need re-wiring. The Lounge is nice. TV has Netflix and the Air Con is pretty good and keeps the apartment cool. WiFi is quick. The bed was comfortable. The Furniture is pretty good. Sofa is comfortable and fairly new and it has a good desk and a place to hang clothes. \n\nCleanliness:\nIn addition to the surrounding noise, the only other issue we had was the cleanliness of the apartment. It looks pretty clean when you arrive but the floor left your feet dirty if you walked around barefoot and when you inspected a little closer (behind sofa or fridge) it was pretty dirty. there is a collection of thick dust in-between the bars of the radiators and there was a strange smell by the bed, which we couldn't work out what it was? Bathroom was very clean. It is an old building/apartment and needs a little TLC in terms of the flooring."

Uns hat besonders gefallen, dass wir separat f\u00fcr uns waren, die excellente technische Ausstattung (super WLAN, TV mit Netflix, Amazon Prime etc), das bequeme Bett und die tolle Dusche/Wanne. Und so viel Platz. Die Kommunikation mit Guillermo l\u00e4uft perfekt via mail. Das einchecken und auschecken war total unproblematisch. Guillermo ist sehr hilfsbereit bei allen Fragen. Manchmal etwas lauter Umgebungsl\u00e4rm, aber in welcher Weltmetropole ist es nur ruhig? Insgesamt sehr zu empfehlen."

Lovely bathroom with a great shower, nice and hot and good water pressure. The neighborhood is quite noisy and its not the most attractive with lots of industrial buildings, but 5 minute walk to the subway which will take you into the heart of Manhattan in 10-15 minutes is great.\nI would happily stay there again"

We had a wonderful stay at the spacious apartment which was absolutely sufficient for our 5-Night-stay. The bed was comfy, the bathroom clean and the kitchen seemed reasonably equipped (we didnt use it). The neighbourhood was quiet at night and the streets relatively empty. The restaurant suggestions came handy when we arrived late at night at the apartment so we headed out to Robertas. Cool place with delicious pizza - unfortunately super busy - even on a Thursday evening - so it seems reservations would be recommended. You can take a cab from the Newark Airport to get there, which is 130$ and takes an hour or you choose the NJ Transit and subway transport which is way cheeper but takes you about 2 hours. The apartment is located close to the subway (L line) which is perfect for travelling to Manhattan quickly."

Perfect. \n\n Williamsburg in itself it a really wonderful location with a very relaxed vibe which we both enjoyed greatly.

The apartment is not in the heart of Williamsburg, more on the outskirts but it\u2019s only 5 mins into Williamsburg and 15 into Manhattan on the subway (the nearest station is a few minutes walk). \n\nThe area looks a little shady when you first arrive but we had no issues at all. There is a pizza place and other takeouts, grocery stores and a couple bars all near the subway station.\n\nGuillermo was very responsive and provided us with all the info we needed in plenty of time. He also gave us phone numbers in case we needed them.\n\nThe apartment is lovely and spacious and the bathroom and kitchen were spotless. It was freezing when we visited and the apartment was always lovely and warm. The only notes I would make is that the blinds in the apartment aren\u2019t very thick so if you are a light sleeper you may want to take a sleep mask. Also, there isn\u2019t really any storage space for you clothes. It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re there for a week (like is) but might be a bit of an issue for people staying longer.\n\nAll in all it is a great base to explore the city and I would definitely stay again on my next trip to New York."

Slept our team of 12 comfortably after a 200 mile relay race and we all loved the house so much! It was even better in person. We all agreed the pictures didn't do it justice. In a beautiful and very quite neighborhood located near Kona town and a short drive to the airport. Loved it!"

We loved the snorkel sets and beach chairs included in this listing. The kitchen was great for our homemade family breakfasts and dinners too. We spent every evening on the wrap-around lanai, it was gorgeous. We would recommend Jubilee by the Sea to our family and friends. MAHALO! \n"

A bit too far from the beach though, and we had to use the car to/from everything, which is the only minus to this house. Would definetly recommend it!!"

The lanai out front was our favorite place to relax and gather morning and evening.  The beds were very comfortable.  The refrigerator was huge.  With a car, we had easy access to the whole coast north and south of Kona.  The snorkeling and other beach gear that came with the house also made our stay easier and more fun!\nThe only con: Two members of our group needed the A/C to sleep.  We found that the A/C in the bedrooms upstairs were kind of loud as it shut off and on through the night.  And the house rule of running it at a 75 degree minimum still seemed warm to us.  But it was still better than nothing, since we didn't want to keep all the bedroom doors open all night to catch the cross breezes (for privacy and to manage the snorers).\nOverall, I would easily recommend this place!

The house had all the appliances we required and we would highly recommend it. Thanks for allowing us to stay in your house."

Loved the wraparound lanai, especially with the lovely view of the ocean.  We cooked most of our meals at the house so it was convenient and helped us save a ton of money.  We also enjoyed eating out at the restaurants suggested by Nate (we loved Lava Java).  The house is fully equipped with beach equipment/toys which we didn't really use (we brought our own) but know that it's there.  Easy access to town and highway.  Overall highly recommend this home and cannot wait to visit the Big Island again and will definitely want to stay here again."

We went to Kona for a family wedding and it was great to have a big house together as opposed to several hotel rooms. In the mornings we had coffee on the lanai while we looked out at the ocean--so lovely! Nate was a wonderful host. He got back to us right away each time we needed something. We did wish for AC window units in the downstairs bedrooms like the ones upstairs. But we were there in August, the hottest time of the year. It probably wouldn't be a big deal to go without AC most of the year. There is usually a nice ocean breeze. Overall, it's a wonderful place and we would definitely recommend it! :)"

Much laughter was had at his home and much loved was shared with our family, from renewal of wedding vows for my husband and I, 1 year anniversary for my daughter and her husband and my husband finishing the Iron Worlds 2017.

There was an upstairs and downstairs living space and refrigerator.\n\nAmenities offered included beach chairs which was great for us - these were to be shared with another property.  We didn\u2019t notice any beach towels but perhaps we didn\u2019t look hard enough since we had our own.  \n\nI admit that I did not realize that only the upstairs living room and bedrooms had AC units, but it was written in the description so I do not fault the host for this - some of our party were very hot downstairs so they just stayed upstairs.  Washer and dryer were on premises but locked up unless asked for - we did have to buy our own laundry detergent.\n\nAll in all, the description was accurate regarding the home.  We did have a great time in the home and we enjoyed our stay.  I appreciated Nate\u2019s extremely prompt responses to any questions I had about the place and being as accommodating as possible."

The rooms are spacious and beds were super comfy. The full kitchen had everything we needed to prepare a dinner and enjoy it out on the lanai if we didn\u2019t feel like going out to eat.  We spent most of mornings and evenings out on the wrap around Lani enjoying the  birds and surroundings. The outside shower was nice to have to make sure the sand was off the kids. Beach equipment, such as chairs,umbrella and snorkel gear was what we needed to head out and enjoy the beautiful beaches. (And it was nice We didn\u2019t have to rent)  Thanks again Nate for everything\u2014till next time "

Our trip was scheduled right when Hurricane Lane was coming through Hawaii, and we were a little nervous that we may not be able to make it to the Big Island on our original schedule. Once I communicated with Nate about our schedule concerns, he went above and beyond to keep me updated about the current weather conditions on the island and in Kona, which really kept me at ease. The house itself is beautiful and is in a great location for sightseeing. I loved the amenities the house provided, including the snorkel gear. I would highly recommend staying here and would definitely come back!"

There is a nice little shop just next door.\r\nThe apartment and the bed clothes+towels was clean - so even it is a full time/only guest apartment we can recommend it."

We were shown around the apartment, and shown all guides personally put together by Regina. The apartment was as pictured and the children loved the apartment, we were within 5 mins walk from a local supermarket be warned parents there are a few steep hills slightly difficult with the stroller buggy but a good workout all the same. We were 10-12 mins walk from the subway Alfonso X only 4 stops from the Ramblas which was \"thumbs up\".\r\n\r\nWe loved our stay our two children were very comfortable in the apartment and loved the patio, there were ample playgrounds in close proximity. The neighbourhood was quiet and locals were very helpful. "

Falta de limpieza absoluta en toda la casa que hac\u00eda muy inc\u00f3moda su estancia y m\u00e1s con ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os. El sof\u00e1 donde supuestamente se pod\u00eda dormir, ten\u00eda una gran mancha que ni se hab\u00edan molestado en intentar limpiarla. Solo hab\u00eda un \u00fanico armario recubierto de moho para guardar la ropa, que evidentemente no pudimos utilizar. La ducha estaba negra, picada y oxidada, lo que nos toc\u00f3 limpiar a nosotros y desinfectarla un poco para poderla utilizar. La cocina llena cubierta por una capa de grasa que la hac\u00eda in\u00fatil para cocinar cualquier cosa. Escaleras hacia abajo completamente empinadas y estrechas.  Nada m\u00e1s llegar ni rastro de Regina o Juan, nos atendi\u00f3 una persona que ni siquiera sab\u00eda hablar bien castellano, por lo que dudo mucho de la existencia de Juan y Regina. Es absolutamente indignante que cuando pagas el apartamento te cobran unos gastos de limpieza que no han efectuado. Para colmo nos cobraron 30 \u20ac en concepto de checking. La zona es tranquila aunque bastante alejada del metro, dado que tienes unas cuestas muy empinadas desde la parada m\u00e1s cernada de metro y luego toca subir cuesta arriba unos 15 minutos. De cara a los esfuerzos por parte del anfitri\u00f3n, absolutamente ninguno. La persona que nos recibi\u00f3 ni siquiera sab\u00eda indicarnos donde estaba la tienda m\u00e1s cercana, un parking donde poder dejar el coche e incluso la parada de metro m\u00e1s cernada. Soy usuario de esta web desde hace tiempo, he visitado otros pa\u00edses de Europa us\u00e1ndola y ha sido con creces la peor experiencia que he tenido. Me siento completamente estafado."

We thoroughly enjoyed the outdoor terrace and spent our mornings out there to eat the breakfast we had prepared in the well equipped kitchen. We did, however, wish there had been some basic kitchen ingredients like salt, spices, or oil there for us to use. The location was a quick walk to Park G\u00fcell and it was nice being in a non touristy area. That did however, mean that it was not as easy to reach the city center. "

First of all, the following guests should know that the pretty view on the pictures is not seen from inside the apartment - not of the windows, no out of the terrace either. That was a big letdown for us. You can see the view only from outside of the building and that's quite confusing. Second, you should know that the mouldy smell on the bedding and the big bedroom are unbearable. Me and my husband couldn't sleep there, it was awful. Fortunately we manage to arrange that problem and sleep in the dining room on the couch that become a bed. The main problem in Regina's apartment is the mouldy smell that she explained is due to the location of the apartment. In spite of all that, Regina was very helpful host. She let us leave our luggage at their family hotel on chek-out day because we had 4 hours to spare before going to the airport. We had a great time mainly on the terrace which is right next to the kitchen. The neighborhood was great - quiet, there is a big market and bus stops very close by. Very easy to get to the city center and even the night buses stopped very close. Bunkers de can Baro are very close to the apartment - 1o min. walk up on the hill. They were spectacular. You'll get a 360 degree view of the city. We had a great time in Barcelona. It's a magical city."

The house is just like shown in the photos, with a beautiful terrace to have your breakfast in the sunny morning. Its well equipped with the essentials and you have a little supermarket nearby to by food. Overall, great place :)"

The aparment is about a 15 min walk to park guell and has a great little grocery store down the elevator and a fantastic view outside  just up the stairs. Be mindful though of the two small flights of stairs down to the aparment they are very small and very steep and narrow. Also be prepared to walk up hill if you go anywhere.  The concierge Alex was wonderful and had great recommendations!"

She checked us in right at 2 pm and was  nice. \n\nThe apartment itself was clean and the couch is actually better than the one in the pictures but some of the decorations were different. No biggie though. \n\nThe only thing about the apartment is there is ONLY ONE FAN. There are 2 bedrooms and 3 sleeping areas but we shared one fan which was impossible. It was very hot in the morning. \n\nParking was a little tricky because of the hills and one way streets but we found a spot by the place. \n\nOverall okay."

TV has a great channels list in Portuguese and English. The apartment is located in a walking distance to the city centre, metro stations, grocery shops, bakeries and pharmacies.

Nice common swimming pool. The neighborhood was even nicer than expected. Right next to the Jardim Botanico, many restaurants in this street and in the Rua Pacheco Leao. The Zona Sul, an upmarket supermarket indeed around the corner (corner Rua Jardim Botanico and Rua Pacheco Leao). We very much liked La Biciclette for breakfast, it is a French bakery on the corner of Rua Pacheco Leao and Rua Von Martius. Also we liked the restaurant SOBE in the Rua Pacheco Leao. Good starters, great view on the Christ as it is partly an open-air restaurant. Roberta and her sister were very nice for us."

The apartment is cute and stocked with everything you need to actually live in it, which I appreciated - good kitchen. Roberta was responsive and accessible. If you're visiting Rio, it's a great base, in a lovely neighbourhood. Two things to keep in mind - it's really quite a small space (standard for Rio, but perhaps a surprise for guests who arrive from outside Brazil) and you hear a lot of street noise, so it's perhaps not ideal for light sleepers. We would stay here again!"
