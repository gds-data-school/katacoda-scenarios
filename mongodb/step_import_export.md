# Import and export data
Here we discuss two useful command available in the
shell to manage large dataset:

1. `mongoexport` is a command-line tool that produces a JSON or CSV export 
of data stored in a `MongoDB` instance.
2. `mongoimport` tool imports content from an Extended JSON, CSV, or TSV 
export created by `mongoexport`, or potentially, another third-party export tool.

## mongoimport

Guide: https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.2/reference/program/mongoimport/

*Tip:* `mongoimport` *is a command that you need to run outside the mongo shell.*

### Exercise 1 
Import json:
1. Create a new collection `movies` in the db `databases` by importing the 
json file `/root/datasets/movies_limited.json`. Use the `mongoimport` command.
2. Test the result of your import by counting the 
rows of your new collection. There should be 16 documents.


### Exercise 2 
Import csv:
1. Create a new collection `cities` in the db `databases` 
by importing the csv file `datasets/cities.csv`. 
Use the `mongoimport` command.

*Hint: the first line of the csv is the header*

2. Test the result of your import by counting the rows of your 
new collection. They should be 128

### Exercise 3 
Import truncating existing data:
1. Import the json file `datasets/movies.json` into the existing 
collection `datasets.movies`, truncating the old data, that we don't need anymore. 
Use the `mongoimport` command and its settings to overwrite the old data.
2. Test the result of your import by counting the rows of your new collection. 
They should be 28795

## mongoexport

Guide: https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.2/reference/program/mongoexport/

*Tip:* `mongoexport` *is a command that you need to run outside the mongo shell.*

### Exercise 4 
Export as json:
1. Export the collection `datasets.cities` and store it as a 
json file in the folder `exported_data`. Use the `mongoexport` command.
2. Check if the file has been created and read its content.

### Exercise 5
Export as csv:
1. Export the collection `datasets.movies` and store it as a csv file 
in the folder `exported_data`. 
Use the `mongoexport` command.

*Optional: exclude the* `id` *field from the export and change the order of the fields (example: year as first column)*

2. Check if the file has been created and read its content.
